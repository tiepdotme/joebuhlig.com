        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/top-five-books-from-2016.jpg" /><p>In the past I’ve wanted to be a reader and yet never picked up a book. But that changed when I said yes to <a href="http://bookworm.fm">Bookworm</a>. Since then I’ve read 16 books for Bookworm and four more on my own. And I’m on pace to read three more by year’s end.
<!--more--></p>

<p>I was recently reflecting on the year and began thumbing through my growing collection of finished books. It was then that I realized I have a few favorites. So I figured why not share them with you? Here are my top five:</p>

<h2 id="deep-work-by-cal-newport">Deep Work by Cal Newport</h2>

<p><a href="http://bookworm.fm/7/">Bookworm</a> - <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692/ref=sr_1_1?tag=joebuhlig-20">Amazon</a></p>

<p>I’ve known the value of setting aside dedicated work sessions for a while. But it wasn’t until I read Deep Work and discussed it with Mike that the importance of disconnection and extended focus on a task fully struck me. It is within those times that my most valuable work emerges. Newport does an excellent job explaining the how and why behind deep work sessions.</p>

<h2 id="the-war-of-art-by-stephen-pressfield">The War of Art by Stephen Pressfield</h2>

<p><a href="http://bookworm.fm/3/">Bookworm</a> - <a href="https://www.amazon.com/War-Art-Through-Creative-Battles/dp/1936891026/ref=sr_1_1?tag=joebuhlig-20">Amazon</a></p>

<p>Regardless of whether we realize or confess it, we are all creative in some way. The degree of creativity within us varies, of course, but it’s there. The trouble is fighting the voice in our mind that tells us not to create and keeps us from doing unique work. Pressfield calls this Resistance and he carefully picks apart the tactics Resistance uses to stop us. I consider this a must-read for anyone who is a maker or who uses knowledge to do their work.</p>

<h2 id="daring-greatly-by-brené-brown">Daring Greatly By Brené Brown</h2>

<p><a href="http://bookworm.fm/9/">Bookworm</a> - <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Daring-Greatly-Courage-Vulnerable-Transforms/dp/1592408419/ref=sr_1_1?tag=joebuhlig-20">Amazon</a></p>

<p>Being vulnerable is not something most of us do voluntarily. And for some of us it invokes fear. The last thing on our minds is being open, honest, and willing to endure rejection. But as Brown points out, that is exactly what we must do in order to achieve and build meaningful relationships. It’s also the key ingredient to accomplishing the big and the impactful. It helps us take a chance and do something important.</p>

<h2 id="managing-oneself-by-peter-drucker">Managing Oneself By Peter Drucker</h2>

<p><a href="http://bookworm.fm/13/">Bookworm</a> - <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Managing-Oneself-Harvard-Business-Classics/dp/142212312X/ref=sr_1_1?tag=joebuhlig-20">Amazon</a></p>

<p>Over the last two years I’ve been on a journey of self-awareness. The value of understanding myself, how I think, and what makes me a good worker is invaluable. Despite having started this adventure previously, Drucker drives the point home in this quick read. It’s packed full of insights that will make you slow down and process the words. This book changed my view of myself and helped me ask the necessary questions that prompted a plethora of personal insight.</p>

<h2 id="the-checklist-manifesto-by-atul-gawande">The Checklist Manifesto By Atul Gawande</h2>

<p><a href="http://bookworm.fm/16/">Bookworm</a> - <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Checklist-Manifesto-How-Things-Right/dp/0312430000?tag=joebuhlig-20">Amazon</a></p>

<p>I’ve been a list maker for years. I know they have a lot of value, but I had never realized why they help and their importance in everyday projects until I read this story by Gawande. As a surgeon, he explains his journey and continual discoveries that led him to the creation of a “safe surgery” checklist. It’s the process and the volume of stories that reveal the power of the simple checklist.</p>

<h2 id="bonus-gods-smuggler-by-brother-andrew">Bonus: God’s Smuggler By Brother Andrew</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Gods-Smuggler-Brother-Andrew/dp/0800796853/ref=la_B000APEW2M_1_1?tag=joebuhlig-20">Amazon</a></p>

<p>Brother Andrew has quite a story about his life of taking Bibles behind the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Curtain">Iron Curtain</a>. It’s one of encouragement and brings with it motivation and a call to action for the Christian. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in a story about the power of the Bible.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/time-tracker-with-running-status.jpg" /><p>I’ve been tracking where I spend my time for a while now. In the majority of cases it has been purely for personal use and decision-making, but since I have now taken a part time IT position, I need to know exactly how many hours I spend on the job and calculate whether or not I’ve met my expected quota for the week.
<!--more--></p>

<p>In theory, it’s simple. I work 20 hours a week as Director of IT at my church. But how do I know if I’m under or over my allotted time? I could go off a feeling, but I’m certain I’ll always be wrong in my estimate.</p>

<p>Instead, I did what I always do: set up a system to track it for me. And with the power of IFTTT, Launch Center Pro, and Workflow, I’m able to let Google Sheets do all the hard work. In the end, this is what I see when I check my status:</p>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-small" src="/assets/posts_extra/time-tracker-with-running-status/time-tracker.jpg" /></p>

<p>Getting the spreadsheet set up is easier by copy-paste than it is by explanation. The formulas are simply too much and too involved to explain. So I created a <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1X2gVw4j-dM6nz1jpGnKqyEONQWPm-Zk61n_P8yKTbOk">copy of my tracker</a> for you to view and replicate.</p>

<p>The part you’ll need to edit is on the Report worksheet. You can manually adjust the Available Hours per week and it will take care of the rest.</p>

<p>As for data entry, I do it all through IFTTT. There are a lot of ways to do it but setting up applets to add a row to a Google Sheet is fairly straightforward.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/using-a-cloudfront-cdn-for-jekyll-without-s3.jpg" /><p>On occasion I find myself with a sliver of free time. And it seems inevitable that I use it to tinker with this site. Given my latest obsession with page load speeds, this time I directed my attention towards the implementation of a CDN.
<!--more--></p>

<p>This is an idea I stole from Brett Terpstra who has an <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/2014/02/21/a-jekyll-cdn-with-cloudfront/">article about his method</a> of doing the same. My case has some slight differences and if you do a search for how to use Cloudfront with Jekyll, you’ll be hard-pressed to find an explanation of how to do it without using S3 for your hosting. Which is why I felt compelled to share my process with you.</p>

<p>I chose <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/">Cloudfront</a> because I’m a fan of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com">AWS</a> (Amazon Web Services) and they are fairly cheap in comparison to the other big names in industry. I’ve worked with AWS enough in the past to trust it. But here’s how I set up Cloudfront to work with Jekyll:</p>

<h2 id="setting-up-cloudfront">Setting Up Cloudfront</h2>

<p>Once you have an account with AWS, open Cloudfront from the management console and create a new web distribution. There are only three settings I changed from the default.</p>

<p><strong>Origin Domain Name</strong> - This is your site homepage. I entered <code class="highlighter-rouge">joebuhlig.com</code></p>

<p><strong>Origin ID</strong> - This is merely a description you want for the origin. I used <code class="highlighter-rouge">joebuhlig.com Resources</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Alternate Domain Names</strong> - This becomes the new base URL you’ll use to serve the files from Cloudfront. I was very original and used <code class="highlighter-rouge">cdn.joebuhlig.com</code> for this.</p>

<p>With the settings in place and the distribution created, you’ll be given a domain name for your distribution that looks similar to this: <code class="highlighter-rouge">abcdefg123456.cloudfront.net</code> We’ll use this to set up our DNS record.</p>

<h2 id="setting-up-dns">Setting Up DNS</h2>

<p>I’m not going into each registrar here, but the idea is to create a CNAME record on your domain with the host as your subdomain (in my case <code class="highlighter-rouge">cdn</code>) and the target as the domain name given for your distribution in the previous step (<code class="highlighter-rouge">abcdefg123456.cloudfront.net</code>).</p>

<p>You want to give this some time to populate and to allow AWS to do its magic. I left it alone and went to work on converting the URLs within Jekyll to accommodate the new CDN URL: <code class="highlighter-rouge">cdn.joebuhlig.com</code>.</p>

<h2 id="setting-up-jekyll">Setting Up Jekyll</h2>

<p>As a Jekyll user, you are probably familiar with using the Liquid tag <code class="highlighter-rouge">{{ site.url }}</code>. That variable is coming from the <code class="highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code> file and we simply want to add <code class="highlighter-rouge">cdn_url</code> to it. Mine looks like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"><span class="na">baseurl</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="s">"</span>
<span class="na">url</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="s">http://joebuhlig.com"</span>
<span class="na">cdn_url</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">http://cdn.joebuhlig.com</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>With <code class="highlighter-rouge">cdn_url</code> in place, you need to go through your static files and image references and change the base URL from a relative reference or <code class="highlighter-rouge">{{ site.url }}</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">{{ site.cdn_url }}</code> instead. I recommend previewing this before you deploy it just to make sure it’s working correctly and that Cloudfront is fully up and running. You can also test this by navigating to the base <code class="highlighter-rouge">cdn_url</code> itself and check if a copy of your site is available. If not, you need to wait for the DNS changes to populate.</p>

<h2 id="jekyll-development">Jekyll Development</h2>

<p>A problem you’ll quickly run into is doing development of CSS and JS when your assets are being served from a CDN. In my workflow I run two commands: <code class="highlighter-rouge">jekyll s --future</code> to test and preview my site and <code class="highlighter-rouge">JEKYLL_ENV=production jekyll b</code> for a production build right before deployment. This allows me to use the Liquid variable <code class="highlighter-rouge">{{ jekyll.environment }}</code> to test if I am in production, like so:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">{% if jekyll.environment == 'production' %}{{ site.cdn_url }}{% endif %}</code></p>

<p>If you use this in conjunction with the <code class="highlighter-rouge">cdn_url</code>, it means that when I’m building for production, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">cdn_url</code> is added and empty if it’s for development. I’m left with relative and local URLs in development and the full CDN URL in production.</p>

<h2 id="cache-busting">Cache Busting</h2>

<p>The last step here is adding a version number to the static assets that change fairly frequently. There are a number of ways to do this but I prefer the tried-and-true query string: <code class="highlighter-rouge">main.css?v=5</code></p>

<p>Just like the <code class="highlighter-rouge">cdn_url</code>, I added <code class="highlighter-rouge">version: 1</code> to my <code class="highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code> file. That allows me to append any asset URL to look like this: <code class="highlighter-rouge">/assets/main.css?v={{ site.version}}</code> When used at the same time as the <code class="highlighter-rouge">cdn_url</code>, I’m left with this:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">{% if jekyll.environment == 'production' %}{{ site.cdn_url }}{% endif %}/assets/css/main.css?v={{ site.version }}</code></p>

<p>Now, I’m lazy and don’t want to manually increment this version number every time I want to bust the cache so I again <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/2013/03/05/site-versioning-with-jekyll/">stole a page from Brett Terpstra’s book</a> and wrote a rake task to do it for me:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="n">desc</span> <span class="s2">"Bump version number"</span>
<span class="n">task</span> <span class="ss">:bump</span> <span class="k">do</span>
    <span class="n">content</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="no">IO</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">read</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'_config.yml'</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="n">content</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">sub!</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="sr">/^version: (\d+)$/</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="o">|</span><span class="n">v</span><span class="o">|</span>
        <span class="n">ver</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="vg">$1</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">next</span>
        <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"At version </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">ver</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
        <span class="s2">"version: </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="n">ver</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="no">File</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">open</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'_config.yml'</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s1">'w'</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">do</span> <span class="o">|</span><span class="n">f</span><span class="o">|</span>
        <span class="n">f</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nf">write</span> <span class="n">content</span>
    <span class="k">end</span>
<span class="k">end</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Now all I need to do is run <code class="highlighter-rouge">rake bump</code> after I’ve edited static files and it will take care of the rest.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/a-baby-time-checklist.jpg" /><p>As I write this, my wife and I are expecting our third baby girl to join us within the next week. I wish I could say there is nothing but pure excitement in our house, but as anyone who has kids knows, there are a number of things to do once you know it is “time.” Depending on your situation, which you can’t predetermine, you may not have much time to accomplish everything and get out the door, so most of us put together a checklist to help us remember.
<!--more--></p>

<p>I use checklists all the time. They are a prominent fixture in my life and it is inevitable that others see me using or creating them. In most cases there is one of two responses: an agreement that the checklist is helpful or a joke about its worthlessness for them.</p>

<p>But despite the reaction, I know I’ll stick by my list. I’m all too aware of the shortcomings of my memory. Even if I remember an item the first 50 times through, eventually it becomes second nature and I’ll be unable to recall if I completed a task or just think I did. It’s much like trying to remember if you closed the garage door. You’ve done it so many times that the task is automatic and there’s nothing to trigger your memory to indicate that you actually did it this time. So you’re left wondering if it happened at all, or turning around to make sure it’s shut.</p>

<p>In the case of going into labor, I want my focus to be on helping my wife. But I still need to make sure all bags are in the car, the hospital is aware that we are coming, that someone is home to watch our girls, and on and on. The situation could be one of extreme urgency (at least to me) and yet I want and need to be attentive to my wife. Thus, a checklist to spell out these mundane but important tasks.</p>

<p>I have a list of things to do that kicks off the moment my wife starts having contractions. It doesn’t make me a robot, it gives my mind the freedom to be attentive to situational needs without worrying about what comes next. The potential for urgency and stress is high. In that moment I want to be there for my wife and not wandering the house trying to make sure I have everything in place. This checklist is far from impersonal. It allows me to be present.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/creating-custom-web-searches-in-alfred.jpg" /><p>Searching is one of the most technically complicated processes to build and yet the simplest to use. And it’s almost universally accepted that every website has a way to search the entirety of their content. Connect this with the ability to search websites directly from Alfred and you can create a one-stop shop for searching all your favorite sites.
<!--more--></p>

<p>Alfred can do searches in Google and many other websites out-of-the-box. But if you notice yourself searching a specific website repeatedly, it makes sense to set up a custom search within Alfred. If you continually repeat this process, you’ll end up using Alfred for all your searches instead of going through the multiple steps required to open a site, find the search bar, and type your query.</p>

<p>To set up a new custom search, you first need to know how the site handles search queries from a URL standpoint. For joebuhlig.com, this is what that looks like:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">http://joebuhlig.com/search/?q=</code></pre></figure>

<p>Once you have that information, open Alfred preferences, go to Features, then Web Search. At the bottom-right you’ll see “Add Custom Search.” From there, simply fill out the details you want for the search. Here’s the full example for this site:</p>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-medium" src="/assets/posts_extra/creating-custom-web-searches-in-alfred/alfred-custom-search.jpg" /></p>

<p>To make it even easier, you can <a href="alfred://customsearch/Search%20joebuhlig.com%20for%20%7Bquery%7D/joe/utf8/nospace/http%3A%2F%2Fjoebuhlig.com%2Fsearch%2F%3Fq%3D%7Bquery%7D">click here to install it directly</a>.</p>

<p>Using this search is quite simple. Invoke Alfred, type “joe” followed by your query. It’ll look like this:</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/using-discourse-for-it.jpeg" /><p>I’m a fan of <a href="http://discourse.org">Discourse</a>. That should come without surprise at this point. As a fan, it’s natural for me to see the potential for Discourse to solve communication problems and create selective visibility within an organization. So it was easy for me to gravitate toward it for the IT communication structure at my church.
<!--more--></p>

<p>To the best of my knowledge, there are four areas that need to be clearly conveyed and accessible to those I support: technology needs, how tos, structural upgrades, and technical documentation. In my case, I have two groups of people to work with: staff members and tech volunteers. The staff needs to share their support requests and have access to the knowledgebase, while the tech team handles the infrastructure and documentation.</p>

<p>In Discourse, this translates quite well. I can create four topic categories (Support, How To, Infrastructure, and Documentation), and two user groups (<code class="highlighter-rouge">staff_members</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">tech_team</code>).  Distinguishing by user groups, I can restrict access as needed in each category.</p>

<p>In my case, there are some end users that will likely struggle if I require them to use Discourse directly. I don’t say this to be mean but to acknowledge that their strengths are outside of computer systems. Understanding this, I take advantage of the email-in feature of Discourse as well as reply-via-email.</p>

<p>My users can send an email to the system and have it handled automatically. Whether it’s a new ticket or a reply to a support update, they can interact solely from their email. Outside of setting up their accounts, they never have to access the system directly. They can stick to what they know: email.</p>

<p>Here’s a breakdown of how each category is used:</p>

<h2 id="support">Support</h2>

<p>This is used primarily for issues and support tickets. Both the staff and tech team can access it and users can send an email into this category. When one of these is completed, I simply close the topic.</p>

<h2 id="how-to">How To</h2>

<p>These topics are checklists or videos explaining how to accomplish a specific task within our building and structures. These can range from website updates to installing printer drivers. Again, this is viewable by both staff and the tech team, but currently I have it restricted so only I can create new topics. I want to vet these before they’re posted.</p>

<h2 id="infrastructure">Infrastructure</h2>

<p>Only the tech team can use this one. It’s designed to capture and discuss system upgrades and migrations as well as the little things we need in order to improve the reliability and functionality of our hardware and software. I think of it as a technical version of the support category.</p>

<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>

<p>Again, this is tech team only. And most of these topics are wiki-fied so that team members can update them as changes are made. These can be descriptions of VLANs or they may list the base computers we use when a replacement is needed. Anything that helps describe the infrastructure so that others can step in should go here.</p>

<p>I’m aware that there are a lot of software options available that are specifically designed for these purposes. And the number of communication methods is endless. But after having worked with and for multiple companies, I’ve seen the pros and cons of using many of them. In most cases the IT team ends up hacking them together to do what they want. Or worse, they lose track of a request in the stream of posts.</p>

<p>What I love about Discourse is its flexibility and configurability. I can dial up or down individual pieces and even allow end-users to avoid it entirely. Telling my staff members that they simply need to send email is tremendously more effective than training how to navigate a new piece of software.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/hybrid-productivity.jpg" /><p>There’s a common misconception in the productivity world that when you develop a new process or system it needs to be entirely digital or entirely analog. Or the more common version of this dilemma: to work toward the use of a single database for your tasks. That may be nice, but it’s far from necessary.
<!--more--></p>

<p>In one week, I join the staff of our local church as Director of IT. As a part of that role, there needs to be a way to track the projects I have going on at the church. A handful of other folks will also be participating in the collection of those projects, as well as taking ownership of them.</p>

<p>For this reason (and many others), I set up a <a href="http://discourse.org">Discourse forum</a> to help me manage the work I do at the church. I can try to duplicate tasks and projects across Discourse and OmniFocus, but why? Yes, this creates two systems to maintain but they serve completely separate purposes. They need to be broken up.</p>

<p>The key here lies in boundaries and hard lines. OmniFocus manages the work I personally need to do and Discourse will track the work I need to do at the church. But this only works if I treat the church as its own context. I work off of Discourse when I am “on the clock.” I shut it off when I’m on my own time.</p>

<p>The same process works with digital tools combined with analog. As long as there are clear lines where one drops off and the other picks up, all is well. It’s when you try to mix systems, duplicate tasks, and create sync methods that issues arise and unnecessary problems surface. It’s okay to use multiple systems.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/autoarchiving-emails-in-gmail.jpeg" /><p>In the midst of reading for <a href="http://bookworm.fm">Bookworm</a>, I discovered my habit of quickly checking my email throughout the day. It’s a simple habit on the surface, but try to break it and you’ll find that willpower alone may not be enough to win.
<!--more--></p>

<p>I set out to create resistance to checking my email from my phone. I can remove it entirely but I have legitimate scenarios that dictate the checking of email on the go. Since I can’t remove it, I decided to force difficulties when opening an email in any scenario.</p>

<p>Instead of removing email on my phone, I wrote a Google Apps Script that moves any read message in my inbox to the archive. And it does so once every minute. It’s basic and seems to not accomplish much since the messages end up in my archive anyway. But what if I need to reply? What if I need to act on that email? If I open it and don’t reply immediately or don’t capture in some way, it’s gone. Not completely, but it’s moved out of sight. And I will likely drop the ball since there is no placeholder in my inbox. That by itself is enough to keep me from opening mails on my phone. I can’t have them disappear.</p>

<p>I should warn you that if you decide to set this up, it will be frustrating at first. I failed immediately and checked my email shortly after installing the script. I saw a message I wanted to read but knew I couldn’t touch it or it would be gone since I didn’t have time to act on it. I spent a lot of time trying to get around this setup and quickly found that I couldn’t check a mail without a lot of extra steps. It’s a lot easier to not check it at all.</p>

<p><strong>Warning: Before going further, make sure read messages are ready to be archived. They will be moved.</strong></p>

<p>To set this up you need to go to your Google Drive and created a new Google Apps Script. Here’s the code to paste into that script:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript"><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">autoArchiveGmail</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">threads</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">GmailApp</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">search</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'label:inbox is:read'</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="k">for</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">i</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="nx">i</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="nx">threads</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">length</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="nx">i</span><span class="o">++</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nx">threads</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nx">i</span><span class="p">].</span><span class="nx">moveToArchive</span><span class="p">();</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>To run it the first time, click the debugger icon and give the script access to your Gmail:</p>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-small" src="https://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts_extra/autoarchiving-emails-in-gmail/debugger.jpg" /></p>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-small" src="https://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts_extra/autoarchiving-emails-in-gmail/permissions.jpg" /></p>

<p>Once the script is in place, set up a new trigger for it:</p>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-small" src="https://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts_extra/autoarchiving-emails-in-gmail/trigger_menu.jpg" /></p>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-large" src="https://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts_extra/autoarchiving-emails-in-gmail/trigger.jpg" /></p>

<p>I wish you all the best in checking email from your phone.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/food-and-productivity-from-a-farm-boy.jpeg" /><p>We all need to eat. The consequences of rejecting that fact are far from pleasant and none of us would argue this reality. The problem comes when choosing which foods to consume. It’s not enough that our supermarkets are overflowing and options are endless; we have corporate marketing schemes, dietary standards, and fear mongering to battle.
<!--more--></p>

<p>I was raised on a large crop farm and I have worked with, for, and around farmers and agricultural companies my entire life. In my journey I’ve helped raise crops and animals, develop new seed varieties and hybrids, and aided the marketing efforts of all the above. I understand what goes on behind the scenes of our food system quite well. And it’s this understanding that has given me clarity in choosing what to eat.</p>

<p>Some of these choices are purely for health reasons. Some are made out of a concern of the unknown or the constantly changing science of diet. But regardless of the rationale behind these decisions, they all lead me to an increase in energy and mental precision. And you could argue that these two results are the foundation of productivity, which means the justification I’ve developed for what I eat is tied not only to a healthy diet but also to my ability to complete tasks.</p>

<p>Enough of the groundwork, let’s jump in with an easy one: processed foods. Most people I encounter understand that these are best left alone. I like to think of them in terms of natural and manufactured complexity. In its natural state, a potato has a lot of complexity to it. There are a lot of nutrients in the skin as well as the heart. But it’s the combination of the two parts that allows it to achieve its dietary value.</p>

<p>But when you remove an element of the potato and introduce a foreign element, you have now manufactured a new complex arrangement of nutrients. Or in some cases, an element is removed and then replaced with a theoretically identical element that comes from a different, cheaper source. In either case, we’ve created a food item that doesn’t exist naturally in our environment. Some scenarios indicate that this is perfectly fine. But most lead to health issues due to a lack of understanding in how to create a food that is perfectly digested and beneficial to the human body. Or, as in most companies, the desire to create a healthy, processed food is secondary to profit.</p>

<p>One of the most difficult and hotly debated conversations you can have about food revolves around GMOs, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_organism">Genetically Modified Organisms</a>. These are crops that have received a DNA alteration in order to enhance or add a trait within the crop. This usually leads people to seeing them as “frankenfoods” but that’s an exaggeration of the facts. The traits being added are typically found within the same species, just not the specific strain that’s being altered. This isn’t always the case, but generally speaking it holds true. The idea of pulling traits from strawberries and combining them with corn is mythology and typically used by fear mongers.</p>

<p>That said, there are tremendous benefits to GMOs. They’ve enabled food producers to grow exponentially higher yields and feed the world with fewer resources and less land. And it is true that they’ve helped farmers cut back significantly on the volume of chemicals used on their land. I’ve seen this transition first hand and I can tell you that the numbers you see on this are conservative. GMOs have proven highly beneficial to everyone raising crops.</p>

<p>However, there is a growing concern over the safety of GMOs. Despite there being a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_crops#Crops">small number of GM crops they have been approved</a>, it <em>is</em> true that they make it into our food system. Which begs the question, are they safe for me to eat?</p>

<p>You can answer this question one of two ways: scientifically or with cautious reasoning. If you read the studies on GMOs, you’ll quickly conclude that they are perfectly safe. But to land at this conclusion you have to trust the source of the studies. In most cases, that source is either the company selling the GM crop or the company selling its processed form to you and me. Personally, I’m not convinced they’re able to do these studies with a completely unbiased approach. And knowing that some of these researchers (I’ve worked with them) will repeat a study multiple times looking for a particular result, I’m often skeptical of their findings.</p>

<p>The other way to answer the GMO safety question is with cautious reasoning. We know that eating whole fruits and vegetables is good for our bodies. There seems to be a perfect relationship between our physical needs and the offerings of these whole foods. If we intentionally alter the makeup of these foods genetically or with post-harvest processing, we are breaking this existing relationship and introducing a new one. It also means that how our bodies react may have unwanted effects on our energy and overall health. This new relationship <em>could</em> work out to be fine. But we’re introducing risk, since there’s so much about the human body we don’t know. We can’t truly comprehend the full impact this new relationship has on our long-term health. I don’t understand why I should voluntarily take this risk. Why would I choose the unknown when the known has a long list (and history) of benefits?</p>

<p>Just to be clear, <em>I’m not saying you should completely avoid and vilify GM foods.</em> They do have a place and save lives daily. But if given a choice and available resources, I err on the side of caution.</p>

<p>Given my experiences, I have learned that eating healthfully has a major impact on my ability to think clearly and creatively. And the better I feel, the better equipped I am to be productive. So to be wise with my time and energy, I need to eat well. For me, that means the consumption of simple, natural foods.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/stop-the-should.jpeg" /><p>One of the strongest fears I grapple with is that of rejection. Like most, I want people to appreciate the work I do and me as a person. My struggle develops when I sense a dislike or underappreciation directed towards me in some way. Red flags start flying and I find myself searching for ways to get out of the scenario.
<!--more--></p>

<p>Over time, I’ve learned who to trust and when. And although I rarely follow through on my thoughts about running away, I still have this nagging sense about what is expected of me. Instead of acting on my fear, I try to weigh it and pay attention to what the other person expects me to do.</p>

<p>However, this presupposition of actions can also rear its head in situations involving only myself. There are times when I feel the need to incorporate something new into my daily schedule. The latest case here is my need for more sleep. Rather than sleep longer at night, I’ve felt that an afternoon nap would better suit me. The fear and “should” that creeps in is telling me that I don’t have time for a nap everyday. I have enough to do. I can’t pull more time away for “leisure.”</p>

<p>Here’s the problem with these scenarios: they leave me feeling like I should say or do something because unspoken expectations have been placed on me. I’m expected to go along with a conversation I don’t agree with. I’m expected to maximize my time perfectly every day. I’m expected to utilize every app or tool to its fullest potential.</p>

<p>These are all things I <em>should</em> do. And when I stop long enough to notice when a “should” has been placed on me, I often find myself asking why. Why should I do this thing? “Because Joe expects it” or “because I paid decent money for this app” aren’t always the best answers. It’s taken time (and I’m still learning) to put a stop to the “should” that is placed on me and gain the confidence to think for myself.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/a-roller-coaster-relationship-with-books.jpeg" /><p>I was an avid reader in grade school. Any program the school put in place to encourage kids to read, I completed as fast as I could. That trend continued until I made it to junior high.
<!--more--></p>

<p>It wasn’t that I didn’t have time, but my rationale and purpose for reading changed. In grade school, I was encouraged to read but it wasn’t a requirement. In junior high, it became homework. Books were selected for me and I hated it. Maybe it was the timing or maybe it was my rebellious side showing its face, but either way I avoided reading as much as possible.</p>

<p>This avoidance continued until late in high school, and the only reason I read a couple books then was because my English teacher assigned books I had a genuine interest in. I can only say this having reflective hindsight. At the time I would say it was due to me liking the teacher. So, as you can guess, it didn’t stick. At the end of high school and early in college I still found myself getting clever at finding book summaries and honing my ability to skim the book for the high points.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, I’ve always enjoyed having finished a book, when I <em>actually</em> read it. That’s a common thread with me; I enjoy the results of hard work but struggle to convince myself to do it. This certainly held true with reading books. I enjoyed being able to talk about a book I had read but didn’t want to start another one. Talk about a weird paradox.</p>

<p>After college I read about a book per year. Because I was no longer reading as homework, I again found pleasure in the reading itself. I could enjoy reading what I wanted, but still didn’t see it as something worth making into a habit.</p>

<p>And then there’s <a href="http://bookworm.fm">Bookworm</a>. An endeavor that has forced me into a reading habit. Bookworm took me from finishing roughly a book each year to completing a book every two weeks. And that has led to reading an extra book between some shows, which means I often read a book each week. This is easily the most reading I’ve done in my life.</p>

<p>Bookworm (and my new habit of carrying a book with me everywhere) has given me a chance to discuss the reading of books more frequently and it seems most folks I run into want to read more but don’t make the time for it.</p>

<p>My point is this: I haven’t always been a reader. It’s something I’ve grown into over time. I can tell you that if you aspire to read a book every week, you’ll likely struggle if you don’t currently read at least one every year. Going 0 to 100 rarely works. Instead, find a page count you can read every day. Even if it’s only one page every day, you’ll end up finishing a book and a half each year. If you can do five pages, you’ll land at about eight books a year. It doesn’t take much to start a habit that quickly compounds itself. Start small and be consistent; let it build over time.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/using-the-permanence-of-paper-as-resistance.jpeg" /><p>The concept of resistance is getting to be common knowledge. In its original context as posed by <a href="https://www.amazon.com/War-Art-Through-Creative-Battles/dp/1936891026/ref=sr_1_1?tag=joebuhlig-20">Steven Pressfield</a>, resistance is entirely negative. It is the internal and sometimes external force keeping us from doing our best work. As good brainworkers we consistently look for tactics, methodologies, and habits to remove and eliminate resistance.
<!--more--></p>

<p>But there’s another side to resistance. You can take the inverse process and instead of removing resistance to doing the positive, you end up creating resistance to prevent the negative. In part, it’s this inverse relationship with resistance that has me using pen and paper for my <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/the-day-on-paper/">daily planning</a>.</p>

<p>I appreciate uniformity and order. That’s a piece of why I build and enjoy structures and systems. It’s also natural for me to write my daily plans in the same format every day. And I don’t like drawing lines through a plan I’ve already made to accommodate a change. Granted, things happen and I’m okay with alterations if it’s an external input dictating the change. But if it’s just me, I don’t want to change it because it will destroy the cleanliness of the plan.</p>

<p>Type A, I know. But that’s how I think. The beauty is that I can create my goal for the day and know that when I put it on paper it pains me to change it after-the-fact. And when I go through the day following the plan and don’t feel like doing the next step, I know that putting it off requires a disruption in the cleanliness of what I’ve written on paper. Strange as it is, I would rather do the unwanted task than break up the structure I’ve created.</p>

<p>I find it interesting how big an impact these little habits can have on the outcome of a day. I may be doing the same process on paper as I can digitally, but because pen and paper have more permanence than an event in my calendar, I’m more prone to following the plan.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/the-day-on-paper.jpeg" /><p>I have tried numerous methods of managing my daily tasks digitally. But no matter the tool or the method, I am unable to replicate the clarity and motivation that comes from using pen and paper to plan and reflect on my day.
<!--more--></p>

<p>Don’t misunderstand. I still rely on digital tools heavily for everything beyond today. OmniFocus and my calendar play a big part in helping me determine what each day looks like. And my <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/the-omnifocus-dashboard/">Dashboard</a> is vital to the execution process.</p>

<p>But planning the day out in my digital calendar doesn’t work. I’ve tried it multiple times. There’s something motivating and more permanent involved in pen and paper. I can’t drag-and-drop a commitment to a different time of day when I used pen. And the longer I commit my plan to paper, the more I’ve learned about myself when the day is done. This learning process has shown me a need for putting three separate portions of my day on paper.</p>

<h2 id="budgeting-my-time">Budgeting My Time</h2>

<p>I’ve talked about this in multiple places, but I find great value in planning each minute ahead of time. I list the date at the top and the hours down the side. While reviewing my calendar and Dashboard, I decide what I will do at each point in the day. This usually happens at night when I’m shutting down the house and prepping for bed.</p>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-small" src="https://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts_extra/the-day-on-paper/daily-time-budget.jpg" /></p>

<h2 id="three-things">Three Things</h2>

<p>To the right of my schedule and on the same page, I write down the three things I need to get done that day (or if I’m doing it the night before, the next day). Above all else, these are my goals to complete. Having no more than three means I can easily recall them throughout the day. Committing to no less than three means I’m not taking it easy. Sometimes I draw a line under them and list a few nice-to-haves, but those are ancillary and I try not to touch them until my three are complete.</p>

<h2 id="journal-entry">Journal Entry</h2>

<p>My schedule for the day and my three things go on the left side of the fold in <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/analog-writing-organization/">my notebook</a>. The right side is for my reflection journal at the end of the day. Some people have a list of prompts they use for journal entry. That’s too much for me. I look at my commitments left of the fold as compared to what I accomplished and write about how I did. Did I check everything off or come up short? It’s the daily comparison of intentions to execution that keeps me coming back to pen and paper.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/behind-the-scenes-of-working-with-omnifocus.jpg" /><p>More often than not, I find myself surprised by the questions I get after releasing a new script or product. After releasing <a href="https://workingwithomnifocus.com">Working With OmniFocus</a> I received more emails about how the site is set up then I did about the course itself. It’s apparent to me that this is something different that others are interested in. So here’s how I did it.
<!--more--></p>

<h2 id="wordpress">WordPress</h2>

<p>The core is WordPress. It’s fast and easy to set up and I knew going this route would open a lot of doors to existing code. I could build the thing myself, but never in the same amount of time. There’s a lot of flexibility in WordPress and I’m very familiar with it.</p>

<h2 id="a-small-orange">A Small Orange</h2>

<p>Anytime I build a new WordPress site, I turn to <a href="https://asmallorange.com/">A Small Orange</a> for the hosting. I can run my own server through <a href="https://m.do.co/c/b0f9f06b6067">Digital Ocean</a> but the peace of mind from handing it off is worth it to me. And frankly, the set up time is much faster and more painless with ASO. Throw in fast, quality support and I’m sold.</p>

<h2 id="paid-memberships-pro">Paid Memberships Pro</h2>

<p>The membership mechanism I prefer is <a href="https://www.paidmembershipspro.com/">Paid Memberships Pro</a>. I like the single, yearly cost of PMPro and the extreme flexibility made possible by their add-ons and codebase. It takes care of my restricted content, payment gateways, the affiliate program, and email newsletter. And buying their annual license allows me to use it across an unlimited number of sites, which is great for building multiple online courses.</p>

<h2 id="theme-my-login">Theme My Login</h2>

<p>I don’t know why more sites don’t use <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-my-login/">Theme My Login</a>. It seems very unprofessional to me when I am presented with the standard WordPress login screen on your site. TML fixes that and it’s free. Use it.</p>

<h2 id="vimeo">Vimeo</h2>

<p>I chose <a href="https://vimeo.com">Vimeo</a> for hosting the videos themselves for two main reasons: embedding control and their player API. I don’t want the videos discoverable anywhere but on my site. That’s how I can make it a paid course. And the API is what allows me to check for the amount of a video that’s been watched by the user, which is important for VimPosts.</p>

<h2 id="wp-vimposts">WP VimPosts</h2>

<p>This is the part most folks ask about. VimPosts is a WordPress plugin I wrote specifically for Working With OmniFocus. It’s what allows me to embed the Vimeo video by adding only the ID number to the WordPress post. It uses the Vimeo player API to decide when to mark a video as “watched” and gives the user the ability to manually trigger “watched” as well. It also creates a shortcode I can use within a WordPress page for creating a list of videos like you <a href="https://workingwithomnifocus.com/list/">see here</a>.</p>

<p>Currently, this plugin is dependent on the Working With OmniFocus website and will break anywhere else. But in my work on Working With Alfred, I plan to make it a standalone plugin. If you’re interested in staying up with the development process, <a href="https://github.com/joebuhlig/wp-vimposts">I have it on GitHub</a>. I have some new features planned for it and have considered making it available as a premium plugin but I’m currently undecided. If it’s something you’re interested in using, let me know in the comments below.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/checking-in-on-dvorak.jpeg" /><p>It’s been about 10 months since I <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/dvorak-transition/">switched to Dvorak</a>. It’s been at least six months since I’ve <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/is-dvorak-worth-it/">written about it</a>. In that six months, I have continued to make improvements but I’ve also noticed an interesting tidbit about my relationship with QWERTY.
<!--more--></p>

<p>First, I’m loving Dvorak. I didn’t have RSI issues beforehand but I can tell there’s less strain on my fingers now. I have no solid numbers on it but I like knowing I can feel the difference. And given the large amount of time I keep my finger tips on keys every day, I can’t help but think this is smart in the long-term.</p>

<p>As for typing speed, I’m still climbing. I’m currently sitting at 118 words a minute. I keep thinking it will plateau but though the rate of increase has slowed significantly, it is still moving upward. I’m guessing it will peak somewhere around 125.</p>

<p>As expected, my QWERTY speed has dropped but lately it’s been holding steady at about 40 words a minute. By my standards that’s pretty terrible, but considering I rarely use QWERTY and am not trying to maintain it, I’m fine with that number. It’s still high enough that I don’t appear to be a complete fool when I use it. At least most of the time.</p>

<p>But here’s the catch: I can’t think about it too hard. If I just type, it works out great no matter which layout I’m on. But if I’m on QWERTY and I try to be intentional about the keys and focus on them, it all comes crumbling down. I have to watch my hands and really work at it.</p>

<p>Overall, I’m still really happy I made the switch. There are some difficulties with being “not normal” but to me it’s worth it. I can deal with the slight setbacks for the sake of the benefits.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/discourse-commenting-for-jekyll.jpg" /><p>For years, Disqus has been the commenting platform of choice. It’s what I used when my site was on WordPress. When I switched to a static site generated by <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, I pulled commenting entirely. But given the topics I write about, comments can be quite helpful and I realize that was a mistake. So I brought them back with the help of <a href="http://www.discourse.org/">Discourse</a>.
<!--more--></p>

<p>There are a number of reasons I chose Discourse, but suffice it to say that I just like it better than the alternatives, which are actually few in number for static sites. I have a unique way of doing the embed process that I thought other Jekyll users might find helpful.</p>

<h2 id="the-discourse-side">The Discourse Side</h2>

<p>Assuming you have an instance of Discourse running (not the purpose of this post) and you are an admin on said instance, you add the host site as an allowed host in the Discourse settings (Customize → Embedding). That will generate the code you need to embed on each page you want commenting enabled. You’ll have to change the embed URL within the code to match the canonical URL of the page it’s embedded on. This is what it looks like originally:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">'discourse-comments'</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"text/javascript"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
  <span class="nx">DiscourseEmbed</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="na">discourseUrl</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">'http://discussion.joebuhlig.com/'</span><span class="p">,</span>
                     <span class="na">discourseEmbedUrl</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">'REPLACE_ME'</span> <span class="p">};</span>

  <span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">d</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">createElement</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'script'</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="nx">d</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">type</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'text/javascript'</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="nx">d</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="k">async</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kc">true</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="nx">d</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">src</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">DiscourseEmbed</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">discourseUrl</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s1">'javascripts/embed.js'</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">getElementsByTagName</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'head'</span><span class="p">)[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">||</span> <span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">getElementsByTagName</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'body'</span><span class="p">)[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]).</span><span class="nx">appendChild</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">d</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="p">})();</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/script&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="the-jekyll-side">The Jekyll Side</h2>

<p>This can’t get more basic. Paste the code from Discourse to the bottom of the post layout in Jekyll. After I make the edit for the embed URL, this is what the code looks like:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html"><span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">'discourse-comments'</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"text/javascript"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
  <span class="nx">DiscourseEmbed</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="na">discourseUrl</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">'http://discussion.joebuhlig.com/'</span><span class="p">,</span>
                     <span class="na">discourseEmbedUrl</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">'{{site.url}}{{page.url}}'</span> <span class="p">};</span>

  <span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">d</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">createElement</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'script'</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="nx">d</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">type</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'text/javascript'</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="nx">d</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="k">async</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kc">true</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="nx">d</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">src</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">DiscourseEmbed</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">discourseUrl</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s1">'javascripts/embed.js'</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">getElementsByTagName</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'head'</span><span class="p">)[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">||</span> <span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">getElementsByTagName</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'body'</span><span class="p">)[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]).</span><span class="nx">appendChild</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">d</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="p">})();</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/script&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="development-tweaks">Development Tweaks</h2>

<p>Every change I make to the site is previewed before deployment. Each post is reviewed as well. So it’s quite normal for me to run <code class="highlighter-rouge">jekyll s --future</code>. But I don’t want any issues with the embed code when I’m in my development environment, so I tell Jekyll to only add the embed code when the site is being created for production:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">{% if jekyll.environment == "production" %}
<span class="nt">&lt;div</span> <span class="na">id=</span><span class="s">'discourse-comments'</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;script </span><span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"text/javascript"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
  <span class="nx">DiscourseEmbed</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="na">discourseUrl</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">'http://discussion.joebuhlig.com/'</span><span class="p">,</span>
                     <span class="na">discourseEmbedUrl</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s1">'{{site.url}}{{page.url}}'</span> <span class="p">};</span>

  <span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">d</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">createElement</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'script'</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="nx">d</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">type</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">'text/javascript'</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="nx">d</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="k">async</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kc">true</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="nx">d</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">src</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">DiscourseEmbed</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">discourseUrl</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s1">'javascripts/embed.js'</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">getElementsByTagName</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'head'</span><span class="p">)[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">||</span> <span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">getElementsByTagName</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'body'</span><span class="p">)[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]).</span><span class="nx">appendChild</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">d</span><span class="p">);</span>
  <span class="p">})();</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/script&gt;</span>
{% endif %}</code></pre></figure>

<p>Now when I’m ready to deploy my changes I run <code class="highlighter-rouge">JEKYLL_ENV=production jekyll b</code>. That sets the environment variable to production instead of development and means the embed code is only included when I’m building the site for real. I use the same trick for my Piwik tracking code. It keeps my external dependencies from creating issues while I am developing.</p>

Remote takes it another step by allowing me to show/hide a program from my phone. At first, I was concerned there might be a bit of lag in activating the action but that fear was immediately eradicated. It’s an instant switch and often happens before my eyes make it back to the Mac.</p>

<p>As an app switcher, Remote is awesome. And given different pages of actions, I can set up different work modes since different tasks require different apps. Take podcasting as an example. Keeping my audio programs and notes a tap away makes recording seamless. But I don’t use some of those applications at any other time, so I keep that set up as a different page in Remote.</p>

<p>This app launching structure is invaluable for webinars and screencasting. It drives me crazy when I watch someone’s screen and they need to search for an open document or program. Or if I’m recording a screencast, this allows me to eliminate the need for fades across screens and lets me jump right into the next window.</p>

<p>Outside of app switching, I use Remote for opening sites I have bookmarked and my most frequent file folders. This works the same way as app launching. Remote opens them immediately on the Mac.</p>

<p>Where I think Remote has power that I have yet to realize is in scripting. I do this with Spotify to get a play/pause button but that’s as far as I’ve gotten. It’s possible to create some sophisticated workflows that can then be launched from Remote. This means you could run some OmniFocus AppleScripts, hide unwanted apps, open other apps, empty the trash, and more with a single tap. Again, I haven’t gone this route yet, but I can see a lot of potential for Remote that I hadn’t considered.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/converting-drafts-text-to-title-case.jpg" /><p>Drafts is easily one of the most used apps on my phone. To me, it is the pinnacle of resistance-free digital capture. If I look through my list of processed drafts, the most common forms of text I capture are content ideas and book suggestions. This tells me I read, write, and record a lot. 
<!--more--></p>

<p>I like my placeholders for these new ideas to be uniform. In this case that means each content idea - whether it’s a blog post idea or a new video - is captured as the title I would use for the content itself.</p>

<p>But let’s be serious, I hate hitting the shift key at the beginning of every new word and I’m terrible at remembering which words should be capitalized and which should remain lowercase.</p>

<p>Knowing the power of Drafts, I asked if it were possible for my capture tool to handle this for me. That question led me to <a href="http://leancrew.com/all-this/2015/06/title-case-in-drafts/">an article about title case</a> and JavaScript by the always excellent Dr. Drang.</p>

<p>Using his script as a base, this is what I landed on:</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/fear-of-the-weekly-review.jpeg" /><p>I’m all about reviews. I think their value greatly outweighs the time involved and energy expended. Most of the time it’s easy for me to initiate a review and step through its checklist, but there are days when I see a weekly review coming up on the calendar and start dreading it immediately.
<!--more--></p>

<p>It’s simple really. My dread is rooted in fear, which is a bit odd to say at first. There is a large group of GTDers who find no value in a weekly review and they often cite their hatred for the practice and the amount of time necessary to complete it. Or they do a smaller, broken up version of a weekly review on a daily basis because it’s overwhelming to do it all it once. But if you look at all of these cases through the lens of fear, you can see surprising similarities.</p>

<p>When I start to fear the weekly review, it’s often because I fell short of my goals for the week, feel overloaded, have to say “no” to projects I love, or haven’t done my due diligence to empty my mind. Doing a weekly review will force me to do un-fun work and make decisions I don’t want to make. But when I’ve achieved my weekly goals and faithfully captured my ideas, I look forward to the review because I know it will validate my success.</p>

<p>When GTDers (myself included) choose to put off the weekly review, it’s often due to fear of what we’ll learn as opposed to time constraints. If it’s valuable, we’ll make time for it. I would even argue that the weekly review is what allows you to trust your system and the foundation of its successful use.</p>

<p>If you’ve sworn off the weekly review or broken it down into smaller daily pieces, why is that? Is there a fear of what you’ll see? Can you trust the system if you don’t regularly validate its accuracy? When do you step back and look at the overall picture of your commitments?</p>

<p>If you’re like me, the times when you fear the weekly review are the times it’s the most important to complete.</p>

When I originally released it as a book, it was $17 at launch and moved to $22 dollars a week later. This worked well from a financial standpoint but it led to a number of emails from folks who missed the early discount. I have no issues with people asking about it, but it took time I wasn’t expecting to give. And from a long term business stance, it also means that potential buyers may hold off on making a purchase thinking the price may come down again in the future. As opposed to playing these discount games, I’d rather it be set and consistent.</p>

<p>When <em>Working With OmniFocus</em> moved to a video course it seemed logical to me (and friends in the business) that raising the price to $37 was easily justified if not a little low. That may be true if I’m trying to make it a more exclusive membership, but I’m not. I would rather it be in the hands of more people and have a broader impact. Following basic supply and demand principles, that means the current price needs to be reconsidered.</p>

<p><a href="https://workingwithideas.co"><em>Working With Ideas</em></a> was plagued with many of the same issues. It was a lot more intensive to develop and after consulting others who have done something similar, I landed on $72. Again, this creates the feeling of exclusivity that I’m <em>not</em> shooting for. Especially considering I’ve left it at the introductory price due to a lack of interest.</p>

<p>And then there’s Working With Alfred. This one is extremely new on the horizon and has a long way to go yet. But the pricing discussion for this one is the same. Where should it land and how can I price it to be accessible to a large number of users while covering my costs?</p>

<p>One thing I’ve learned in my pricing adventure is that I love simplicity and consistency. I also place value in reaching higher numbers of people with the resources I create. So that means I want to bring everything to a uniform price, preferably at the lower end of my comfort zone. Based on my experience and trusting my intuition, that leads me to $17 for each.</p>

<p>So effective today, <em>Working With OmniFocus</em> and <em>Working With Ideas</em> are each <strong>$17</strong>. And I’m no longer doing discounts or release pricing. It’s also means that when Working With Alfred is released it’ll be $17 as well. I’m keeping it simple and dependable.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/multiple-lines-in-drafts-to-multiple-tasks-in-omnifocus.jpg" /><p>One piece missing in my Drafts actions arsenal was the ability to create a single draft with multiple tasks and send them all to OmniFocus via the new URL schemes. This isn’t something I use often but there are times when it would be useful and can be the difference between capturing everything and missing a vital thought.
<!--more--></p>

<p>So here we are. I made one. You can <a href="x-drafts4://x-callback-url/import_action?v=2&amp;tintColor=%5B%0A%20%200.451%2C%0A%20%200.29%2C%0A%20%200.553%0A%5D&amp;shouldConfirm=0&amp;logLevel=1&amp;uuid=5E08F0B3-C571-4996-A264-85A42A72C277&amp;disposition=2&amp;actionSteps=%5B%0A%20%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%22scriptText%22%20%3A%20%22%5C%2F%5C%2F%20Script%20steps%20run%20short%20Javascripts%5Cn%5C%2F%5C%2F%20For%20documentation%20and%20examples%2C%20visit%3A%5Cn%5C%2F%5C%2F%20http%3A%5C%2F%5C%2Fhelp.agiletortoise.com%5Cn%5Cnvar%20text%20%3D%20%5C%22%5C%22%3B%5Cnvar%20tasks%20%3D%20draft.content.split%28%5C%22%5C%5Cn%5C%22%29%3B%5Cnfor%20%28i%20in%20tasks%29%20%7B%5Cntext%20%2B%3D%20encodeURIComponent%28%5C%22-%20%5C%22%20%2B%20tasks%5Bi%5D%20%2B%20%5C%22%5C%5Cn%5C%22%29%3B%5Cn%7D%3B%5Cn%5Cndraft.defineTag%28%5C%22OFTasks%5C%22%2C%20text%29%3B%22%2C%0A%20%20%20%20%22actionStepType%22%20%3A%20%22Script%22%0A%20%20%7D%2C%0A%20%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%22actionStepType%22%20%3A%20%22URL%22%2C%0A%20%20%20%20%22urlTemplate%22%20%3A%20%22omnifocus%3A%5C%2F%5C%2F%5C%2Fpaste%3Ftarget%3Dinbox%26content%3D%5B%5BOFTasks%5D%5D%22%2C%0A%20%20%20%20%22useSafariViewController%22%20%3A%20false%2C%0A%20%20%20%20%22encodeTags%22%20%3A%20false%0A%20%20%7D%0A%5D&amp;description=&amp;modifiedAt=2016-09-28%2020%3A21%3A37%20%2B0000&amp;name=OmniFocus%20-%20Multiple&amp;iconImageName=action_reminder">install it here</a>.</p>

<p>For those interested, it uses a JavaScript step that breaks each line of the draft apart and reassembles them in taskpaper format. This new string is stored in a new tag that can be used in the URL step.</p>

<p>Here’s what the JavaScript looks like:</p>

<p>And here’s the URL step:</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/time-for-a-refresh.jpg" /><p>This past weekend my wife was gone on a retreat. That meant I took care of our girls on my own. They go to bed about an hour and a half before I do, and like any self-respecting web developer with an aging web design, I took advantage of the extra free time and made some major changes to the look and feel of my home on the web.
<!--more--></p>

<p>The biggest change here are the layouts of the header and article feeds. Headers are always a challenge because you want them to be unique but they need to follow intuitive interface standards. This one took me 20+ iterations to get right and to feel good about. In the end, I wanted it to be simple to understand and easy to find what you’re looking for.</p>

<p>Compared to the article feed layout, the header was simple. I went through 40+ versions of the layout, colors, and metadata to show. I know that there are a lot of factors that I personally look at when deciding to read an article. And I understand the frustration of not being able to find that one piece of data you need to get the context of the post. So I did my best to call out the date, tags, and length of each post so it’s easy to get the background of the article before you jump in.</p>

<p>To go along with the look and feel is the new ability to use a dark or light theme. I stole this idea from Federico Viticci over on <a href="https://www.macstories.net">MacStories</a>. I love his implementation of it and built my own version. Since it’s my blog and I’m a huge fan of dark themes, I made the dark theme default. You can switch back to the light theme with the theme toggle in the header. Though, I’m not sure why you would do that.</p>

<p>The last change worth noting is search. I moved over to <a href="http://lunrjs.com/">lunar.js</a> to calculate the results for the search. This is primarily due to my use of <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> as a site generator. Lunar makes it a lot easier since I don’t have any server-side methods I can use to generate the search results. You can use the search box in the header or by visiting the <a href="/search">dedicated search page</a>.</p>

<p>Overall, I’m really happy with this new setup and excited to share with you. But I’m very aware that redesigns like this often come with unexpected bugs. If you find an issue, please let me know about it in the <a href="#discourse-comments">discussion below</a>.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/zen-the-art-of-work.jpg" /><p>I’ve always admired the thought and intentionality that Kourosh Dini applies to his methods of working and developing structures that help him accomplish his tasks. So I was excited when he gave me the opportunity to go through his video course, <a href="https://gumroad.com/a/753349747"><em>Zen &amp; The Art of Work</em></a>, prior to its launch. I must say that I think this is his best work to date.
<!--more--></p>

<p>Dini has a reputation for writing in-depth, thought-provoking books and those books were instrumental in guiding me to develop my own processes. But he’s now taking another step in the creation of video modules that illustrate what I would call a combination of <em>Deep Work</em> and <em>Getting Things Done</em>.</p>

<p>I’ve been a practitioner of GTD for a long time and a recent convert to the concept of Deep Work sessions. Dini is able to use visual representations in conjunction with practical examples of how these concepts work together in real life scenarios. Because of this, <em>Zen &amp; The Art of Work</em> is one of (if not the) best demonstrations of how these principles can lead to the calm, intentional practice of getting work done that matters.</p>

<p>I have to confess that I was surprised by the number of takeaways I had after completing the course. Some are simple, almost obvious. Others were completely new to me:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pause before going onto the next task.</li>
</ul>

<p>I have a habit of just working down a list. A simple pause between tasks can help me be more intentional about what I’m doing. It becomes a way to prevent any haphazard ways of working.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Be with the work.</li>
</ul>

<p>Like most information workers, I deal with almost constant desire to procrastinate. Dini introduced me to this idea of just being in the presence of the work to be completed and doing nothing else. And I can tell you that the amount of self-control necessary to start the work, once you put yourself in the presence of the work, is much less with this practice in place.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Designing work sessions.</li>
</ul>

<p>I had never thought about work being done in sessions prior to reading <em>Deep Work</em>. I had loosely practiced this but never intentionally. Dini is able to carefully articulate how work sessions can be initiated and focused in a way that sets you up for following through on your intentions. He gave me a clarity about sessions that I had been seeking.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Process inboxes after each session.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the past I’ve been consistent in clearing my inboxes every morning. But Dini suggests clearing them at the end of every work session. This is mostly due to his recommendations on how to leverage the power of an inbox while in the middle of a session, but it has me clearing “in” more often each day. And the mental freedom that has come with it has been surprising. It is certainly a practice I intend to maintain.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dini’s music is excellent for work sessions.</li>
</ul>

<p>As part of the course you get a bonus album of Dini’s music. I have long been searching for soothing music that is suited for my writing time and have yet to discover anything as perfectly suited as this album. I’ve known Kourosh composes songs for a while but for some reason I’ve never listened in the past.</p>

<p><a href="https://gumroad.com/a/753349747"><em>Zen &amp; The Art of Work</em></a> is an excellent course for those looking to be intentional with the work they do. It’s perfectly suited for newcomers to the productivity space and will be at the top of my list of recommendations for where to start. But it’s also a great resource for those who’ve been at it for a while. The real world examples are invaluable and Dini can easily demonstrate how to implement these concepts. I highly recommended this course.</p>

<p>For more information on the course, you can visit <a href="http://www.zenandtheartofwork.com">zenandtheartofwork.com</a>.</p>

<p><small><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I was given a free copy of the course for this review and it includes affiliate links. I can honestly say my opinion of the course hasn’t been colored by this fact, but regardless, it’s something I felt you should know.</small></p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/targeted-omnifocus-templates-with-workflow.jpg" /><p>I’ve been impressed by the speed of the Omni Group’s release cycles lately. It’s obvious they are hard at work on the automation methods for both iOS and macOS. One of these recent releases introduced the ability to create new projects within a specific folder on iOS.
<!--more--></p>

<p>It’s pretty straight-forward. You use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/paste</code> URL as before but replace <code class="highlighter-rouge">target=projects</code> with <code class="highlighter-rouge">target=/folder/FOLDERNAME</code>, so you now get something like this:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">omnifocus:///paste?target=/folder/Articles&amp;content=TASKPAPERCONTENT</code></p>

<p>This opens a lot of doors, but I prefer to keep things simple by using a single Workflow. This new Workflow takes a text file in DropBox (containing a taskpaper template), replaces any placeholders (using this format: <code class="highlighter-rouge">«PLACEHOLDER»</code>), and places the new project in the folder you choose from the menu.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/86f951099b6d40fcacfe7b0e4ab41d65">get this Workflow here</a>.</p>

<p>If you look through the steps, you’ll see an action that looks like this:</p>

<center><img class="post-image-mini" src="https://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts_extra/targeted-omnifocus-templates-with-workflow/workflow-targets.png" /></center>

<p>These are the selectable targets in the Workflow. You’ll want to alter these to fit your structure. Just pay attention to the text and variable assignment under each choice and be sure to copy that format.</p>

<p>In the end, this allows me to pinpoint where I want my templated projects to land within OmniFocus without needing to manually move it after creation.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/forget-third-party-email-apps.jpeg" /><p>Folks are quite passionate about the software they use to access their email. I fell in that camp for a while but anymore I just don’t get it. I think that stems from my intent to touch emails only once, keep my inbox as empty as possible, and use a single archive folder for all emails I want to keep.
<!--more--></p>

<p>My needs in an email app are just as simple. I need an easy way to move an email to either an archive or the trash. That’s it. And since there’s an internet connection and a Mac with me 99.9% of the times I check email, I do all of it in the browser with Gmail.</p>

<p>That means I have no need for integrations with other apps because I always have a URL to reference an email. I can always grab the link, drop it into a notes field, or save it as part of a reference document. It also means the email is always a click away.</p>

<p>I have no need for fancy folder structures and snoozing mechanisms. They don’t make sense to me. It’s an extra layer of complexity and decision deferment that delays progress on the requests represented in the emails. I don’t want to postpone my action on it for later, I make the decision the first time I see it.</p>

<p>When I read reviews or hear comparisons of new email apps, I’m usually left asking “why?” Why are all these extra features necessary? Why is everyone trying to solve the “email problem?” The extra bells and whistles won’t make your decisions for you. It won’t write your responses for you. That’s up to you.</p>

<p>We all get email. Some of us get a lot more than others. And if you feel you have an email problem, <em>you</em> need to do something about it. The issue isn’t the app. Don’t complicate matters looking for a third party app. Keep it dead simple and own your decisions. You’ll feel a lot better in the end.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/building-systems-you-wont-use.jpeg" /><p>I’m always looking for a way to automate a process or develop a structure that removes steps from a frequently repeated task. That’s to be expected since I enjoy the world of productivity and do a fair amount of development.
<!--more--></p>

<p>But building new systems to increase efficiency and accomplish new actions used to be relegated to the Mac or PC. You can write scripts and code there that do really sophisticated tasks. The only limit is your imagination and time devoted to it.</p>

<p>With the creation of apps such as <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/workflow-powerful-automation/id915249334?mt=8&amp;at=1l3vnyQ">Workflow</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/launch-center-pro-shortcut/id532016360?mt=8&amp;at=1l3vnyQ">Launch Center Pro</a>, and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/editorial/id673907758?mt=8&amp;at=1l3vnyQ">Editorial</a>, the system building process has more or less made its way onto iOS. And I leverage these heavily in my daily iPhone use.</p>

<p>Although this ability comes with a plethora of benefits, it also comes with a very large downside: <em>time consumption</em>.</p>

<p>My general rule of thumb for development and systems building is “if you can think it, you can build it.” If you have an idea for a script or a new system, you can generally make it happen given enough time and resources. Yes, there are occasions that this assumption falls down, but in my experience it generally holds true.</p>

<p>If you combine this assumption with the flexibility, ease, and novelty of an app like Workflow, it’s easy to find yourself looking for ways to use it. “It has so much power, I should use it for <strong>__</strong><em>__</em>.” And new workflows are fun to build, so you get to “work” on a new process that will help you later.</p>

<p>The trouble is that it’s time-consuming to build these new systems and since we utilize an app just because we can, we end up building things that serve no real purpose in our daily activities. It’s cool that you can turn a series of pictures into a GIF but how often do you need to do that? Is it really necessary to spend time building these out if you’re only going to use it a couple times, if ever?</p>

<p>My point is this: don’t waste time building new systems just because you can or you think there might be a use for it. Determine the need up front and then get to work. Make sure it has a necessary and legitimate use before you spend time creating it.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/creating-drafts-actions-in-bulk.jpeg" /><p>When the Omni Group implemented the new <a href="https://discourse.omnigroup.com/t/implementation-details-for-omnifocus-2-14-automation/24179?u=joebuhlig">automation methods in OmniFocus for iOS</a>, I was both excited and worried. I had over 30 actions in Drafts that send text to OmniFocus using background emails as an action method. Switching all of those to use URLs was going to take some time.
<!--more--></p>

<p>But then I remembered Drafts has its own URL scheme that allows you to import actions. So I embarked on a journey to create my 30+ actions in bulk. I likely spent more time working this out than it would have taken me to just edit each one by hand, but now I have a trick to share with you. You’re welcome.</p>

<h2 id="1-manually-create-a-template">1. Manually create a template</h2>

<p>You first need a template to work with. Create one action that the rest of your actions will be modeled after. In my case, it looked like this:</p>

<p><img class="post-image-mini" src="/assets/posts_extra/creating-drafts-actions-in-bulk/template.png" />
<img class="post-image-mini" src="/assets/posts_extra/creating-drafts-actions-in-bulk/template-steps.png" />
<img class="post-image-mini" src="/assets/posts_extra/creating-drafts-actions-in-bulk/template-url-step.png" /></p>

<h2 id="2-copy-the-action">2. Copy the action</h2>

<p>After your template action has been created, open it up and use the Share Sheet to copy it. This copies the import action URL for the Drafts action that we’ll dissect.</p>

<center><img class="post-image-mini" src="/assets/posts_extra/creating-drafts-actions-in-bulk/template-share-button.png" />
<img class="post-image-mini" src="/assets/posts_extra/creating-drafts-actions-in-bulk/template-share-sheet.png" /></center>

<p>Here’s a paste of this action so you get an idea of what you should see:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">x-drafts4://x-callback-url/import_action?v=2&amp;tintColor=%5B%0A%20%200.451,%0A%20%200.29,%0A%20%200.553%0A%5D&amp;shouldConfirm=0&amp;logLevel=1&amp;uuid=0E3E5B59-15B5-4010-8E8C-C9A69EE0CA88&amp;disposition=2&amp;actionSteps=%5B%0A%20%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%22actionStepType%22%20:%20%22URL%22,%0A%20%20%20%20%22urlTemplate%22%20:%20%22omnifocus:%5C/%5C/x-callback-url%5C/add?x-success=drafts4:%5C/%5C/&amp;name=%5B%5Btitle%5D%5D&amp;note=%5B%5Bbody%5D%5D&amp;project=Bulk%20Actions%20Template&amp;context=Running&amp;autosave=true%22,%0A%20%20%20%20%22useSafariViewController%22%20:%20false,%0A%20%20%20%20%22encodeTags%22%20:%20true%0A%20%20%7D%0A%5D&amp;description=&amp;modifiedAt=2016-09-07%2012:02:42%20+0000&amp;name=Bulk%20Actions%20Template&amp;iconImageName=429-checkmark2</code></p>

<h2 id="3-transfer-to-numbers-or-excel">3. Transfer to Numbers or Excel</h2>

<p>You need to get this copied URL into a spreadsheet. I did mine on the Mac so I also needed to transfer it across devices. We’ll use the spreadsheet to create new URLs in bulk.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts_extra/creating-drafts-actions-in-bulk/spreadsheet.png" alt="Spreadsheet" /></p>

<h2 id="4-create-a-list-of-new-actions">4. Create a list of new actions</h2>

<p>You need a list of the new actions. Specifically, you need a list of the text that changes in the URLs. This will be used to create the new import links.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts_extra/creating-drafts-actions-in-bulk/spreadsheet-list.png" alt="Spreadsheet List" /></p>

<h2 id="5-break-up-the-url-template">5. Break up the URL template</h2>

<p>This really depends on the complexity of your Drafts actions but you need to look through your URL template and break it into the pieces that stay the same across all the new links. You want to remove the text that changes and keep the remaining pieces in separate cells in the spreadsheet. This makes our lives much simpler when we start putting it all back together.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts_extra/creating-drafts-actions-in-bulk/spreadsheet-url-breakup.png" alt="Spreadsheet Breakup" /></p>

<h2 id="6-format-the-replacement-text">6. Format the replacement text</h2>

<p>In my case, the URL template used a project name that matched the name of the action. So I created one format to the right of my list that handles both cases. Just pay attention to how your template looks and make sure your new text matches the original format.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts_extra/creating-drafts-actions-in-bulk/spreadsheet-substitute.png" alt="Spreadsheet Substitute" /></p>

<h2 id="7-create-the-new-urls">7. Create the new URLs</h2>

<p>Once the template is broken apart and the replacement text has been formatted, we can concatenate all the pieces back together to create our new URLs.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts_extra/creating-drafts-actions-in-bulk/spreadsheet-new-urls.png" alt="Spreadsheet New URLs" /></p>

<h2 id="8-transfer-to-ios-and-import">8. Transfer to iOS and import</h2>

<p>Select all those new URLs, copy them, and transfer them to iOS. I just pasted them into a text file that syncs via DropBox and opened it in Editorial. Then it’s just a matter of tapping the link to add each action to Drafts.</p>

<center><img class="post-image-mini" src="/assets/posts_extra/creating-drafts-actions-in-bulk/editorial.png" /></center>

<p>I’ll admit this isn’t a clean process, but it gets the job done. And for the spreadsheet wizards, I’m aware that there are more unified ways of creating the new URLs. But if you know those methods, you likely don’t need this tutorial.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/when-deep-work-strikes.jpeg" /><p>There are a plethora of articles promoting and dissecting the tenants and principles proposed by Cal Newport in his book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692/ref=sr_1_1?tag=joebuhlig-20">Deep Work</a>. That’s what led me to picking it for an <a href="http://bookworm.fm/7/">episode of Bookworm</a>. After implementing my takeaways for about a month, I can see a decided difference in my productivity and effectiveness. It’s what allowed me to release <a href="https://workingwithomnifocus.com">Working With OmniFocus</a> when I did and to develop the depth of detail in those videos.
<!--more--></p>

<p>If you haven’t read Deep Work, I will join the crowds in saying you should. It can change your methods of working and make you rethink the importance of the internet. In my case, it led to alterations in many core routines and habits I maintain.</p>

<p>The biggest change I have successfully implemented is a simple <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/contact">contact form</a> over a blanket email address on this website. Over time I had begun receiving hundreds of emails each day. It’s not possible to keep up with that kind of volume. And as Newport points out, email rarely produces a meaningful result. By putting systems in place to help me cut back on email received and removing expectations that I’ll respond to every one of them, I take back more of my time and free myself to focus on essential projects. Email is still important, but it’s not worth sacrificing my mission in life to answer the requests of others.</p>

<p>Newport talks about the value of a shutdown ritual, which is a way of closing off the work of today, preparing for tomorrow, and transitioning from work to family. I’ve experimented with an “End of Business” ritual before but I have always struggled getting it to stick. Reading Deep Work made me dust off my old checklist and give it another try. The clarity that comes when I follow through with this ritual makes me wonder why it was so hard to make this a habit in the past. I can only assume that a difference in perspective and season of life makes me see a greater value in closing off the day and intentionally shutting down my work mode.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts_extra/when-deep-work-strikes/shutdown-ritual.jpg" alt="Shutdown Ritual" /></p>

<p>Easily one of the most valuable action items you can take from the book is scheduling deep work sessions: time when you disconnect from all external inputs and focus on the one task in front of you. This is time spent unplugged and head down on a creative or critical project. And it is paramount that you keep the internet at bay. Its ability to send you down rabbit trails is uncanny and detrimental to the work that matters. To help combat the allure of infinity apps and their addictive tendencies, Newport suggests scheduling time for going online.</p>

<p>On the surface, I love this concept. Only allowing a set amount of time for the web forces you to be intentional with that time and see it as a tool with a purpose. But in practice, it’s been extremely challenging to even put a plan together. I know there are benefits on the other side, but my business is online. It feels irresponsible to limit that time. But taking a cue from <a href="http://www.becomingminimalist.com/">Joshua Becker</a>, I think I’ll have to pick a day and experiment with less time online. My anxiety is likely an indicator of the importance of trying.</p>

<p>To help with this trial, I reviewed a topic on the Discussion site by <a href="http://www.jayblanco.com/">Jay Blanco</a> about <a href="http://discussion.joebuhlig.com/t/setting-up-your-phone-for-deep-work/245?u=joebuhlig">setting up a deep work phone</a>. The thoughts shared there and my own reflections on the internet-as-a-tool mentality have led me to turning off cellular data and Wi-Fi on my phone.</p>

<p>Deep Work has lead to great progress on projects with a lot of value. I have some ground to cover yet, but the simple understanding of how to engage in deep work and suppress the time and energy devoted to shallow work has exponential benefits over my normal methods of getting things done.</p>

<p>Something I didn’t plan on with this project was the expansion of content. By the time I finished the set of videos, I realized there are over four hours of content and an additional 40% in topics covered over the book. And I already have another hour worth of topics in the queue. So it’s easy to say that this is a pretty extensive resource and I’m really excited to share it with you!</p>

<p>Quick note: if you’ve previously purchased the book, check your email. There’s a present waiting for you there. If you haven’t bought the book, you can still get it as part of the video series. I’m keeping it simple and throwing it all into one package.</p>

<p>Go check out <a href="https://workingwithomnifocus.com">the new website</a>! There are a handful of freebies there even if you’re not planning to buy.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/a-year-without-extra-screens.jpeg" /><p>For the last year I’ve been running my business from a MacBook Pro  and an iPhone.  No iPad. No Watch. And no external monitors.
<!--more--></p>

<p>This started out of necessity. I had jumped into bootstrapping my business quicker than I wanted and knew I shouldn’t spend extra dollars on unnecessary gadgets. So I took on the bare essentials.</p>

<p>At first, this was painful. I had done development and data analysis work for quite a while and had been able to use iPads and at least three monitors for years. I could easily argue the validity of multiple monitors for someone doing my line of work. To go from three 27” Thunderbolts and an always-on iPad at my desk to nothing more than a MacBook Pro screen was not fun.</p>

<p>To be honest, the freelance development and online business world isn’t all roses and rainbows. I haven’t felt comfortable spending extra dollars on a nice-to-have that isn’t necessary for me to do my job. So I’ve spent the last year working with the same minimal setup I started with.</p>

<p>Despite the wounds this inflicted at the onset, I’ve discovered some unexpected benefits and learnings from this unwanted experiment. I can’t say everyone will experience these and frankly some will say these are illogical conclusions. Regardless, my feelings on the topic remain.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Multiple screens don’t increase productivity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When forced to work from a single, small screen, you find ways to make the process as easy as possible. Instead of designating apps to specific locations on a specific screen, I found a <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/mac-navigation/">way to quickly switch</a> to a screen filling view of an app. With a single keyboard shortcut, I jump from program to program. But that means my need to see multiple things at once is no longer necessary because I can switch about as fast as my eyes can move to another screen and back.</p>

<p>The other aspect at work here is pure willpower to focus. Multiple screens increase the speed at which I can be distracted. Even if the distraction is productive, it still takes me away from my intended task. A single screen forces me to look at the application and task in front of me. I have to make a conscious decision to navigate elsewhere.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Device overlap is detrimental to focus.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I owned an iPad, it served two purposes. It was used to read articles and watch videos and it became a dashboard for my task list, outline, or reference material. Without it, I read articles and watch videos on my phone or Mac. But honestly, I do this very little anymore. And from what I can tell, I’m better off scaling this back even further.</p>

<p>The lack of the dashboard has been a different story. It was a big loss initially since I’ve been using an iPad that way for three years or better. I struggled to find an alternative. As expected, I eventually found a combination of tools and techniques to simulate what I was doing previously. But what surprised me was the fact that my “new” methods were already in place. I had been switching between the iPad and my iPhone for a task list. My outlines and references were a shortcut away on the Mac. I had been duplicating the main purpose of the iPad on the Mac and iPhone already.</p>

<p>It’s tricky, but I found there was a split in focus when there were options about which device to use. Because I could choose between devices for a given task, I would have to make an extra decision (iPad or Mac?) about the right one in the moment. Remove the decision (the extra device) and I can get to work quicker and, in most cases, more effectively. Without the choice and the potential overlap in devices, I’m free to focus on the task itself instead of asking which device to use for the task.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Owning every Apple device isn’t logical.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ll say it. I’m an Apple fanboy. Every product with an Apple logo has me looking for an excuse to own it. But each time I consider one, I’ve had to ask myself, “What does this enable me to do that I can’t already do and need to do?”” It’s the last piece of that question that always throws me off. There’s a lot of new and shiny with Apple products, but at the end of the day, I’ve learned that it takes only a couple of them to do what I need and to do it well.</p>

<p>All that said, there are changes I would make and I <em>would</em> increase my screen count by one. But I would only do so in the realm of Macs. Given my work in audio/video lately, I would put in either an iMac or a Mac Pro with a single, large monitor. I’m unsure of the exact hardware needs at the moment. But to allow travel, I would pick up a new MacBook. I can do a light weight machine for this, since it only needs to do email and raw text when I’m away from my office. I wouldn’t buy an iPad and I wouldn’t go for more than a single monitor for the Mac.</p>

<p>When will this happen? I don’t know. But learning how to work with so little has taught me where I want to go.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/information-overwhelm-without-the-internet.jpeg" /><p>I hear people refer to information overwhelm more often than I would expect. The context varies but the idea is the same: finding information on the internet is so easy that the person has a hard time deciphering what is right and what to question. Some even take it as far as to suggest <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/07/is-google-making-us-stupid/306868/">Google is making us dumb</a>.
<!--more--></p>

<p>The validity of that statement and my opinion of it aren’t important for the context of this article. What is important is the cause of the overwhelm: a broad range of topics at our fingertips. Type a word into any web search tool and you are hit with page after page of words to consume. It boggles your mind when you try to comprehend the complexity of the systems behind the interface that deliver those search results.</p>

<p>And regardless of your opinion on the effects this has on our brains, it’s safe to say that most of the results are surface level articles. In other words, the vast majority of the internet articles out there will focus on the introduction of a topic or dive deep into one small aspect of a broader discipline. When combined and reviewed collectively, it’s possible to ascertain expert levels of knowledge about a given search. But more often than not, it requires a great deal of time and experience in scouring the web to develop that level of expertise from search results.</p>

<p>In most cases, we aren’t going to take the time necessary to understand a topic fully. We would rather skim the headlines we find, get our answer, and move on. This is where the traditional sense of information overwhelm comes in. There are so many potential solutions to our query that we have difficulty discerning which trail to follow. It’s overwhelm due to a wide variety of topics made available to you.</p>

<p>But I’ve recently discovered a different type of overwhelm. Instead of this <em>broad topics overwhelm</em>, there’s also <em>deep topic overwhelm</em>. Both flavors come with two constraints: a lot of information going into your mind in a short time frame. With the broad form, we see a variety of subjects available to us through systems like Google. But the deep form flips the equation and gives us a ton of detail about a single realm of knowledge. In my case, this is revealed through the rapid consumption of business and productivity books.</p>

<p>You could make the argument that given wisdom in writing queries you could create a list of search results that would emulate deep topic overwhelm. But again, you will be presented with a series of webpages that would need to be reviewed collectively and digested over a longer period of time. At that point you no longer fall into the constraint of a short time period, whereas reading multiple longform works on a single subject in short succession does.</p>

<p>A prime example of this difference is the book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0143126563/ref=sr_1_1?tag=joebuhlig-20">Getting Things Done</a>. There are countless people, myself included, who discovered the GTD framework through searches and failed to implement it successfully until they broke down and actually read the book. Despite the thousands of articles out there about GTD and, in my case, months of reading them, you’ll never reach a level of full understanding until you read the book.</p>

<p>But if you read a lot of these types of books in a short time, you’ll quickly start to feel this deep topic overwhelm. There’s so much information and an incomprehensible level of rationale behind each author’s arguments that you can’t help but notice numerous aspects of your life and work that you want to change or develop. You have loads of data entering your mind that you want to act on and feel like you can’t keep up.</p>

<p>The logical response is to slow down. Give yourself time to process and adapt. In my case, that’s not possible since my quick reading is a part of <a href="http://bookworm.fm">Bookworm</a>. But I’m convinced I would continue my biweekly pace even without the podcast and accountability. There are two reasons for this:</p>

<p>One, <strong>I’m able to draw correlations and similarities I wouldn’t otherwise have seen</strong>. Given the short timeframe that I consume these books within, I have found that I still have a deep recollection of the last seven to ten that I’ve read. The book I am currently reading ends up being colored by what I’ve learned across thousands of pages I am still intimately familiar with. I find connections across multiple texts that I would normally miss.</p>

<p>Second, <strong>the new information I’m learning becomes motivation to keep moving forward with action items and deepens my rationale for what I’ve learned</strong>. Reading a thought-out reasoning for an author’s belief will encourage you to either develop your own perspective or challenge you to reconsider your existing view. In both cases, you come out better on the other side.</p>

<p>When you have the ability to be both broadly overwhelmed and deeply overwhelmed, through the internet or through books, you can choose between two responses: you can wait to learn until you need a piece of information, or you can take advantage of your good fortune and learn as much as possible right now. I’ll take the latter.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/woodworking-versus-websites.jpeg" /><p>One of the most difficult aspects of building websites or doing knowledge work full-time is the lack of motivation and pride that typically comes from physically seeing the work of your hands. Yes, it is possible to achieve this sense of accomplishment when working purely with information and computers, but it’s far from natural.
<!--more--></p>

<p>Looking at my own life, I compare it to woodworking. When I build a piece of furniture I rarely need a to-do list for it. And (given available time) I don’t struggle with getting to work on it like I do a bug-fix. I know that I can go to the woodshop, see my current progress, immediately determine what comes next, and get to work. And when I’m done, there is a innate joy that comes from having built the piece or at least made progress on it.</p>

<p>But when it comes to websites, it’s a different story. I need a list to know where I left off. And I have to develop tricks and rituals to motivate me to get to work. Even after I’m done with the build I need to reflect on my work and put it in perspective to understand its value and develop pride in my work.</p>

<p>The weird part of this is that I really enjoy both. But I do think there’s value in understanding the feelings and mechanics that come with working as a craftsman. If they can be applied to knowledge work, I think there is a drive and enjoyment we can achieve that has typically been reserved for those working with their hands.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/moving-omnifocus-scripts-to-ios.jpeg" /><p>I have been hesitant to adopt the <a href="https://discourse.omnigroup.com/t/implementation-details-for-omnifocus-2-14-automation/24179?u=joebuhlig">new automation methods in OmniFocus</a> for iOS. The abilities of the new URL Scheme are exciting but there’s still quite a bit missing from the structure as it stands.
<!--more--></p>

<p>The main piece I found missing was the “autosave” parameter to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">/add</code> URL. My current structure uses the <a href="https://github.com/joebuhlig/OFScripts/tree/master/Auto-Parser">Auto-Parser</a> which allows Drafts to send tasks to the app without the need to confirm or edit an item. Thankfully, the Omni Group introduced this feature recently and I can now add items directly to OmniFocus on iOS and come back to Drafts without any extra steps. Here’s the URL I’m using to add new Blog Post Ideas:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">omnifocus://x-callback-url/add?x-success=drafts4://&amp;name=[[title]]&amp;note=[[body]]&amp;project=Blog%20Post%20Ideas&amp;context=Running&amp;autosave=true</code></p>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">/paste</code> URL is a different story. Combined with Editorial or Workflow, this thing is awesome! It allows me to port two of the AppleScripts I use over to iOS.</p>

<p>The obvious one here is templates. <a href="https://discourse.omnigroup.com/t/automation-in-omnifocus-2-14-released-2016-04-26/23985?u=joebuhlig">Ken Case shared an Editorial workflow</a> that takes a template project in Taskpaper format and adds it to OmniFocus. I’m using his workflow unedited and found it really easy to recreate my templates on iOS. Navigate to the project you want to use as a template, tap the Share button, and copy it. In Editorial I simply pasted the project into a new Taskpaper file and I’m set. All I have to do is open the template and run the workflow.</p>

<p>The other script I moved over was the <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/reading-books-on-a-schedule/">“Read Book Tasks” script</a>. This was a complete rebuild of the code in Workflow. Using it on iOS is the same as running the script on a Mac. Run the workflow, answer the prompts, and you get a sub-project for the tasks added to your inbox.</p>

<p><a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/cece509a6fd6477d8d9e479f3f5df184">OF Book Tasks - Workflow</a></p>

<p>Everything above is about creating new tasks. In the world of data, we often refer to CRUD - Create, Read, Update, Delete. It’s shorthand for the four ways you can work with information. You can make new data - Create. You can get existing data - Read. You can change or edit existing data - Update. And you can destroy the data - Delete. If you have the ability to do all four of these, you are able to do anything you want with the database.</p>

<p>If we overlay those four methods on top of the new OmniFocus URLs, we see only the first (Create) as a possibility. So we’re still limited in what we can do on iOS. It’s also why I’m not able to move <a href="https://github.com/joebuhlig/OFScripts">all of my scripts</a> to iOS. It simply isn’t possible. Given the support for AppleScripting that the Omni Group shows, I can imagine it is only a matter of time before the RUD of CRUD makes it to iOS.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/too-much-tech.jpeg" /><p>One of the common threads in the books we’ve read for <a href="http://bookworm.fm">Bookworm</a> is the impact of computers on our effectiveness, self-control, and overall happiness in life. Their prevalence and ubiquity in our world coupled with the newness and speed of their adoption has a lot of us wondering and speculating about the positives and negatives of this shift. So I would expect any book written in the last decade to incorporate thoughts on the topic.
<!--more--></p>

<p>David Allen is a big proponent of using the latest technology in creating an external brain. The ability of these devices to manage information and deliver it at will is astounding and enables us to find whatever we want, whenever we want it. David’s GTD methodology (proposed in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0143126563/ref=sr_1_1?tag=joebuhlig-20"><em>Getting Things Done</em></a>) is perfectly aligned with and almost dependent on the mobility and universality of computers.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1583335080/?tag=joebuhlig-20"><em>The Willpower Instinct</em></a>, Kelly McGonigal explains the neurological processes and chemicals released when using many of today’s most popular applications and social networks. They are a double edged sword in that they connect us with people all over the world, but they also create never ending potential for distraction that we must overcome by developing a level of willpower. This is similar to Stephen Pressfield’s view of Resistance in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/War-Art-Through-Creative-Battles/dp/1936891026/ref=sr_1_1?tag=joebuhlig-20"><em>The War Of Art</em></a>. It’s easy to let the notifications and possibility of something new keep us from creating our best work.</p>

<p>And if you start asking yourself questions about what is absolutely essential in your life as Greg McKeown suggests in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Essentialism-Disciplined-Pursuit-Greg-McKeown/dp/0804137382?tag=joebuhlig-20"><em>Essentialism</em></a>, you start to question the necessity of technology in general. Our access to information and interconnectedness are nothing short of remarkable. Throw in home automation and our capabilities are hard to fully comprehend. But to what gain? Are those things indispensable? Do they introduce an unnecessary level of complexity just because we can? Where is the line of too much?</p>

<p>I hate those questions. I have a tendency to adopt new technology because of the cool factor and for the sake of experimentation and knowledge. I want to know how something works and see how I can use it. The pros and cons battle hardly enters my mind. I don’t want to consider its benefits because I’m afraid there are none. And in most cases I know that it will be another thing to maintain and support when it doesn’t work correctly.</p>

<p>For the past year I’ve been without an iPad. For someone in my line of business, that is absurd. It wasn’t a goal or even intentional at first. I left the company I was working for at the time and needed to return the company iPad I had been using. Finances didn’t warrant the purchase of a replacement right away so I was forced to go without an iPad for the first time since they were introduced.</p>

<p>After 12 months without one, I’m seriously wondering if I would ever buy one as a replacement. I can’t find a legitimate purpose for it in my life that doesn’t increase the complexity of what I do and how I work. In other words, <em>I don’t miss it.</em></p>

<p>It’s this same rationale that I’ve applied to an Watch. What does it gain me that I can’t already accomplish? I already wear a watch and I always have my phone around. I simply cannot justify it.</p>

<p>However, there are a couple areas I would like to introduce a bit more tech. External monitors and an external hard drive for my MacBook would help me out considerably. But even then, I’m only augmenting an existing computer as opposed to introducing a new device entirely.</p>

<p>I don’t think there’s some magical line for technology to which we all need to adhere. The level of interconnectedness and digitization we each desire and can manage in our lives is different. But I think I have my line for now and I enjoy the freedom these limitations give me.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/embracing-the-new-textexpander.jpg" /><p>When <a href="https://smilesoftware.com/">Smile</a> introduced the new “Snippet As A Service” version of TextExpander, there was quite an outcry. To be completely honest, I was confused by and resistant to the change at the onset. However, if I look at the new version without allowing my previous experience to color my opinion, it is striking how similar it is to my other choices for software.
<!--more--></p>

<h2 id="data">Data</h2>

<p>One of the big complaints is the location used for data storage and syncing. Previously, we used DropBox or some other syncing service to host and update our snippets as we alter them. The new version forces you to use <a href="//smile.7eer.net/c/298450/277331/2936">textexpander.com</a> as the backend. I understand the concern over data control here but it really doesn’t apply to me. I already use the backend for other software and services like OmniFocus, Workflow, and Overcast. This isn’t much different.</p>

<h2 id="pricing">Pricing</h2>

<p>This is the one that got me at first. Year-over-year, the price to me would increase almost twofold. At least, that’s what it was originally. Since release, Smile listened to the flood of feedback and generously implemented a 50% upgrade discount for life. In the end, that means I’m paying no more than I have in the past. It’s a wash.</p>

<h2 id="subscription">Subscription</h2>

<p>Anymore I’m slow to upgrade hardware. But software is a different story. I deliberately limit the number of tools I use, which means I pick quality, pro-user tools with a lot of features and flexibility. Any time these tools have an upgrade available, I like to jump on it quickly. If you look at it from a high-level, I am effectively paying a subscription plan already. By adopting this recurring payment structure, I get no-hassle updates without the worry.</p>

<h2 id="new-features">New Features</h2>

<p>My big question when I first saw the release of the new TextExpander was about features. What’s new that would lead me to upgrade? I didn’t have an answer. But then I tried the trial and found two features that are important to me and a third I’m considering.</p>

<p>The first is inline search. You type a keyword anywhere, hit a keyboard shortcut (that you can customize), and see search results of your matching snippets. Since we typically have these memorized it may not sound very useful until you consider the pain of changing your snippet abbreviations or a database with hundreds of snippets. I find the need to alter abbreviations every few months which means the inline search ability has received a lot of my attention.</p>

<p>Second, the <a href="//smile.7eer.net/c/298450/277331/2936">website</a>. It seems unnecessary at first. If you have the apps, why would you use the website? Then I ran into a couple instances where I wanted a block of text from TextExpander while on a different profile on my computer. I don’t want TextExpander on it for other reasons but it’s incredibly handy to log on to the website to access that data. It makes it possible to retrieve the info I want without a software installation.</p>

<p>And the feature I’m considering is the one that initiated this whole thing: teams and sharing. I can see a lot of value in sharing email templates with clients or for <a href="http://bookworm.fm">Bookworm</a>. Anytime there are communications, blocks of text, or forms that are used by multiple people, this could save us all a lot of time. I haven’t tried it yet, but I’m looking for the opportunity.</p>

<h2 id="personal-use-only">Personal Use Only?</h2>

<p>With all of this in mind, I’m happy with my choice to upgrade to the new TextExpander even if I choose not to use the sharing features. There’s enough added value in the new version and consistency in pricing (for me) to convince me to buy in. TextExpander is one of those core applications I incorporate into a lot of other tools. That means I want it up-to-date. And since there are new possibilities that come along for the ride, I’m exploring the options that the new functionality gives me.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/leaving-pocket-for-instapaper.jpeg" /><p>I follow specific websites less and less. I’m more inclined to follow people and services on Twitter and <a href="https://medium.com/@JoeBuhlig">Medium</a> that act as sources of curated articles. This gives me the ability to find sites I normally would have glossed over and still read my favorite writers.
<!--more--></p>

<p>But regardless of where I find these articles, I still need a way to save them for later. I rarely have time to read an article the moment I discover it. In the past I’ve used Pocket, but I have now moved to <a href="https://www.instapaper.com">Instapaper</a>.</p>

<p>Originally, I chose Pocket for its IFTTT integration. I had built a number of recipes that acted on the tagging ability of Pocket. But over time I slowly turned these off one by one, mostly due to my move away from tagging articles.</p>

<p>I still would’ve stayed with Pocket if they had simply left the URLs of the articles alone. When I’m finished with an article, I either archive it or share it. But if you share it through Pocket, they insist on shortening the URL with their custom link. The only way around it that I have found is to have <a href="https://workflow.is/">Workflow</a> expand the the link before sharing. When I see links shared by others, I use the top level domain (TLD) of the link as part of my decision about whether or not I want to read it. So I don’t want my own links preventing that ability.</p>

<p>Coupled with the link shortening is the difficulty in sharing quotes from Pocket. It is similarly complicated to do so without the Pocket custom link. Contrast this with Instapaper, where it works perfectly without the need for Workflow actions to expand the link and format the text. Instapaper uses the link you originally saved and gets out of the way.</p>

<p>The reading experience is also far better on Instapaper. They give a lot of options to customize the reading view. And since these are apps designed for reading, I feel this is paramount. The experience in Pocket is not bad, I simply prefer the environment created and allowed by Instapaper.</p>

<p>When I realized I was no longer using IFTTT with Pocket it gave me the freedom to explore other options. And because I have been watching Instapaper for a long time hoping their IFTTT integration would progress, it was the perfect time to switch. I no longer needed Instapaper to adopt a deeper relationship with IFTTT, so I could make the transition with zero compromises.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/base/WorkingWithOmniFocus-Small.png" /><p>It’s been about nine months since I released <em>Working With OmniFocus</em>. A lot has happened in that time and my systems around OmniFocus have morphed quite a bit. Throw in a pile of learning accrued from other projects and I have decided to make some significant changes to the book.
<!--more--></p>

<h2 id="video">Video</h2>

<p>Easily the most prominent change will be the medium through which the content is delivered. Words on page work well, but when software is involved video can be a better route to follow. The ability to visually demonstrate a concept and how it works can dramatically increased the comprehension level of the viewer. So in the near future <em>Working With OmniFocus</em> will no longer be a book, but a repository of over 60 screencasts explaining and visualizing the idea at hand.</p>

<h2 id="location">Location</h2>

<p>I originally built a custom Ruby and Rails application to host the sales page and associated mechanisms for the book. That works well but gets to be a lot of maintenance that I’d rather not have. So <em>Working With OmniFocus</em> is moving to a new home on the web: <a href="https://workingwithomnifocus.com">workingwithomnifocus.com</a>. Obviously, this is currently under development and will continue to change over the next few weeks.</p>

<h2 id="dynamic">Dynamic</h2>

<p>One of the major difficulties in writing a book about software is the static nature of a book compared to the continual development of the software. It makes it difficult to keep the book up to date. By moving to web-based video and breaking the content into smaller pieces, it allows me to tweak the content as the program changes.</p>

<h2 id="pricing">Pricing</h2>

<p>I hate pricing. Throw in discounts, launch promotions, and levels of access and it’s a nightmare to me. I have avoided much of this by sticking with a single price and I’m not leaving that mindset. In this case, the content will be more advanced and have more depth so I know the price will need to increase over the price of the book. I don’t currently have an answer on what it will cost, but I do know that those who have purchased the book (and those who <a href="https://tools.joebuhlig.com/working-with-omnifocus/">purchase it before the relaunch</a>) will receive $20 off the videos.</p>

<h2 id="affiliates">Affiliates</h2>

<p>The current affiliate program for the book has been a big success for me and I plan to continue to run one for the videos. But since I’m rebuilding the site, the mechanism will be different and will require you to sign up again for the new program. I know this is inconvenient but it will be better for all of us in the long run.</p>

<h2 id="book">Book?</h2>

<p>I’m not planning to update the book itself and the ability to purchase it by itself will go away. I will, however, make it available to those who purchase the video series with the caveat that my processes mentioned in the book are out of date.</p>

<h2 id="overall">Overall</h2>

<p>I’m really excited about these changes.  I will be able to explain the mindsets and demonstrate the app mechanisms in much more detail than was ever possible through the book. I’m devoting most of my current working time to these edits and plan to deliver it in mid to late August.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/textexpander-and-omnifocus.jpeg" /><p>TextExpander and OmniFocus are <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/first-apps-on-a-new-mac/">two of the first tools</a> I install on any new device, so it’s no surprise that the two work well together. You may expect some kind of Applescripting or shell magic, but I keep this extremely simple and only use true text expansion with OmniFocus. I run the scripts manually or behind the scenes with Hazel.
<!--more--></p>

<p><strong>xwait = “Waiting for “</strong></p>

<p>This is easily the most commonly used snippet I have for OmniFocus. Any time I need to create a new Waiting For task, I always type <em>xwait</em> and keep going. It’s not a huge savings in one instance but multiply this by the average 20 uses a day and it really adds up.</p>

<p><strong>xresp = “Waiting for response from “</strong></p>

<p>Similar to the first, I use this one a lot. I receive and send a ton of email. Any time I send one that warrants a response, a new task is created and this is where the naming starts.</p>

<p><strong>xplan = “Plan project for “</strong></p>

<p>Most of the time when I decide to take on a new project, I don’t have time right then to plan it out. So I use this to create a task for the planning process.</p>

<p><strong>xpfm = “Plan for meeting re: “</strong></p>

<p>I don’t use this as much as I used to, but this helps me create a new task as a reminder to review meeting materials and get resources together for a call.</p>

<p><strong>xlook = “Look into “</strong></p>

<p>I do a ton of research to help me get better at a project or learn how a new process works. I always start these tasks with “Look into” as an indicator to Google, read, or learn about the item.</p>

<p><strong>xdwc = “ (Delete when complete)”</strong></p>

<p>I stole this one from <a href="http://www.usingomnifocus.com">Kourosh</a>. I sometimes have repeating tasks that are creative in some form or don’t have a clear definition of “completed.” I augment the end of the task title with “(Delete when complete)” so I know to delete the task instead of check it off when I’m done with it. That will keep it from repeating when it’s done and allow the project to move on.</p>

<p><strong>x5tom = “5am tomorrow”</strong></p>

<p>Occasionally, I need to push a task off until tomorrow. When I do, I use this in the Defer Date field to push it out one day. I could hit the “+1 day” button but this is habit.</p>

<p>Overall, this is extremely basic compared to what is possible. But this does all I need,  there’s no point overcomplicating it.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/my-current-home-screen.png" /><p>When I <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/the-overwhelm-inbox/">consolidated a handful of my inboxes</a> into my email it made me rethink my home screen. I had previously kept it slim but this takes it a step further and creates significant resistance to activities better left undone.
<!--more--></p>

<p>The biggest time wasters on my phone and the ones I have consolidated are social media, RSS feeds, and email. Once those were all funneled into email, they didn’t need to be on my phone at all. That meant Feedly, Google+, Pinterest, and LinkedIn all disappeared.</p>

<p>The big one here was Feedly. I normally used it as a triage tool, sending articles I wanted to read to Pocket. But I’ve always disliked their need to auto-shorten links when I share an article. It was bad enough that I built <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/workflow-to-share-articles-with-twitter-handle/">Workflow actions to overcome it</a>. The main reason I originally used Pocket was the IFTTT integration. This inbox consolidation process made me comb through my recipes and realize I wasn’t using IFTTT with Pocket anymore. I had slowly turned off all the connections with it. Goodbye, Pocket. Hello, <a href="https://www.instapaper.com">Instapaper</a>. I’ve wanted to switch for a while anyway.</p>

<p>Once I deleted a few apps, I started thinking through how I use my phone. If the app isn’t on the front screen, I swipe down and search for it. If I’m going to launch apps with Spotlight, why keep multiple folders of them? I combined them into a single folder in order to bury the apps that are most tempting, but still keep them around for their Share Sheet functions. These are primarily Twitter and Instagram.</p>

<p>I’ve been using my phone this way for about a month now and it has seriously helped me limit my phone usage. It’s geared toward getting work done as opposed to blowing time. If I’m going to blow time, I’m <a href="http://bookworm.fm">better off reading</a>.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/introducing-working-with-ideas.jpeg" /><p>Our ability to come up with ideas is like a muscle. If we work on it and develop the right habits, we get stronger and have more options available to us. But it’s difficult to build muscle if you don’t understand “how” the muscle works and the mechanics behind its improvement. Getting ideas is challenging until you learn what they are and how they work.

Very few of them explain the scenarios necessary to make their conclusion valid.

<p>We all operate differently, and we all have different skill sets and ways of thinking about the tools we use. We have varying needs and that means there is no absolute on the best tool for a task. This is why I always say, “I don’t know” when asked what task manager you should use. I have no clue what your circumstances are and what you need from a list manager.</p>

<p>This is precisely why many people (myself included) recommend using tools you already know when taking on a habit or system. It eliminates the need to learn a new tool and a new structure at the same time. But it’s more than that. The new structure will push you to develop a new mindset. Over time, you will begin to think about the items within your process in a more nuanced way as your ideas and rationale behind it progress.</p>

<p>Tools can get in the way of developing this nuanced thinking. You may start searching for an app to solve procrastination when you actually need to name your tasks differently. You need to understand yourself, how you operate, and what you need before deciding a new tool is the solution. And you can only take on a new tool successfully when you know what it offers that will suit your mindset. <em>That’s</em> when the articles comparing software are helpful.</p>

<p>It is only when you can sit down and spell out how a new tool will help that you understand your mindset well enough to warrant a potential change.</p>

Let’s change that.

<h2 id="equipment">Equipment</h2>

<p>I did a lot of research on beginners microphones before I started podcasting and although there are better ones out there, I landed on the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rode-Podcaster-USB-Dynamic-Microphone/dp/B000JM46FY/ref=sr_1_1?tag=joebuhlig-20">Rode Podcaster</a>. I have a dream of upgrading to a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Shure-Supercardioid-Condenser-Microphone-Applications/dp/B0002BACBO/ref=sr_1_1?tag=joebuhlig-20">Beta 87</a> at some point, but this does a great job for now. Altogether here’s what I’m using:</p>

<ul>

<h2 id="software">Software</h2>

<p>I have been a subscriber to the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/creativecloud.html">Adobe Creative Cloud</a> for a while now and really enjoy the power of their tools. They aren’t for everyone, but if you have access to it <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/audition.html">Audition CC</a> does a great job of editing and recording. When I’m recording with someone else, I use the traditional set of software that most podcasters use:</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="hosting">Hosting</h2>

<p>In my opinion, the gold standard for hosting your files is <a href="https://www.libsyn.com/">Libsyn</a>. It just works and I’ve never had an issue with them. My feed is a custom XML file generated with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>.

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/time-for-books.jpeg" /><p>In order to read a book every two weeks (and sometimes every week) I have had to make reading a practice that is incorporated throughout my day. Having a single time for reading isn’t enough and it has become a ritual I like to incorporate as many places as I can.
<!--more--></p>

<p>Each day is different, but I know I can count on a handful of repeated situations that allow me to read consistently.</p>

<h2 id="early-mornings">Early Mornings</h2>

<p>Every morning, I <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/why-getting-up-early/">get up at five</a>, grab a shower, and make a hot breakfast for myself. This early breakfast always consists of two eggs fried in a cast iron skillet and a banana. While the skillet is warming up and the eggs are cooking, I read. When they are finished cooking, I read while I eat. This is easily the most reliable time I have for reading. It’s a relaxed, ritualistic, and energizing time that is perfect for creating motivation for the day ahead.</p>

<h2 id="transitions">Transitions</h2>

<p>Whether it’s a few extra minutes before a meeting or a quick break between tasks, the transitional periods throughout the day serve as excellent times to grab a book. It may only be a single page, but one page here and there can add up quickly. The beauty of reclaiming these transitional times comes from what it replaces: social media and email checks. Instead of losing 10 minutes to cruising Twitter, I finish a chapter in my book.</p>

<h2 id="waiting">Waiting</h2>

<p>I have started taking a book with me whenever I leave the house. I’m early to most meetings and often find myself waiting for others to show up. Having a book with me means I can get a few more pages read instead of perusing blog articles or email on my phone.</p>

<h2 id="eob-ritual">EOB Ritual</h2>

<p>At the end of my workday, I go through an End Of Business ritual that helps me unwind and clear my head for spending time with my family. I have tried various tactics during this time, but I have found that learning is the best at hitting the brakes on my mental race car. And what better way to learn than to read? So I’ve made it a habit of reading for about 15 minutes before calling it a day.</p>

<h2 id="bedtime">Bedtime</h2>

<p>The least reliable of my reading times is likely the most consistent for others. I am sporadic at reading before bed, but it is another time that is easy to take advantage of and turn a few pages in a book.</p>

<h2 id="the-pattern">The Pattern?</h2>

<p>When I reflect on each of these scenarios I notice a recurring theme. In every instance, I have historically focused my eyes on a screen instead of a book. It’s easy to check my phone for a few minutes before bed or while I am eating breakfast. But if I pay attention to how I feel afterwards, I always prefer the feeling of accomplishment after having read a book to the feeling of inadequacy that comes from checking a screen.</p>

<!--more--></p>

<p>I find these moments bittersweet. They often result in something much better, but they also bring with them an extensive amount of rework. This was precisely my experience when I took on my second book, <em>Working With Ideas</em>.</p>

<p>I was working on the outline and collecting segments of content when I realized the medium for this content and its delivery system was wrong. It needed to reveal more emotion and story with more camaraderie than an e-book can provide. So I changed direction and turned it into a full video course with a community of idea workers to share the experience with.</p>

<p>I consider this my best work and I’m thrilled to share it with you. I’m so excited about it that I decided to make it possible to <a href="http://pre.workingwithideas.co">get the course for free</a>! To get started, you simply need to <a href="http://pre.workingwithideas.co">sign-up for the launch email</a> (which gets you $12 off by itself).</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/an-open-letter-to-productivity.jpeg" /><p>My friend,</p>

<p>We’ve come a long way since we met five years ago. And I cannot thank you enough for the clarity and direction you’ve given me through the multiple transitions and big decisions I have faced in recent years. Without the systems and tricks you’ve taught me, I would accomplish much less and fall short of numerous goals. For that, I am grateful.
<!--more--></p>

<p>I know I don’t always stick to the structure you’ve helped me build, but you’re always there when I realize I’ve stepped away. I know that if I trust the guidelines and follow them, my days are efficient and invigorating; and that makes me want to keep going and do more. It reveals my ability to do something great.</p>

<p>But sometimes I need space. I know you want me to be efficient with my calendar but there are periods when I need to blow some time with no expected outcomes. I need a little freedom. I need to be flexible and play once a while.</p>

<p>I think you would agree that margin is beneficial, but you often expect a measurable result when I take a break. I can understand that. We both know that taking time to re-energize can lead to greater gains elsewhere. But that’s my point: I can’t always look for the benefit of an activity. Why must everything have a defined positive outcome? Why not be content with the lack of definition and embrace spontaneity and play?</p>

<p>I want to continue our friendship, but with a different perspective. Let’s focus less on doing more and more on doing right. That likely means fewer projects, but I want them to be <em>better</em> projects. I know you’re with me here. But let’s also invite Play to our meetings. I’m aware of the love-hate relationship between you. Let’s work through that together. Between the three of us, I believe we can accomplish something awesome.</p>

<p>I’ll see you tomorrow.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/reading-books-on-a-schedule.jpeg" /><p>For years I have wanted to read more books. Prolific readers rave about the benefits and world-renowned leaders often attribute their ideas and successes to their habit of reading, but to me the benefits of having read a lot of books  was secondary to the innate sense that a realm of knowledge and experience was available to me, but I was missing it.
<!--more--></p>

<p>Missing out on something is not inherently bad. It is actually a good thing in many cases. With firehoses of input available at every turn today, we need to decide to miss out on some things. And the more we can cut, the more head space and time we have to expand our minds and work towards our goals in life. I will be the first to say I am bad at this. Resisting the constant pull of potential updates is a war I fight daily.</p>

<p>In time, I have cut back on these overwhelming streams of unnecessary input, but I have only done so successfully with the addition of a replacement habit: reading books. Frankly, I don’t have the self-control to pick up a book instead of my phone when the “just check” bug bites. I rely on staged environmental circumstances to make it happen. I leave my phone out of reach and keep a book readily available. That helps significantly, but taking it another step, I have committed to completing a book every two weeks.</p>

<p>This accomplishes two things. One, I need to read a significant portion of a book each day to hit my mark. Two, it forces me to look for time to read in the day. The combination of these two means I do not have near the time for social media and email as I did previously and instead use that time for books.</p>

<p>But there is a flaw in this design that I discovered early on. My procrastination tendency leads me to back loading the two-week period with higher page counts. This is mostly due to not knowing if I am on track to hit my goal on a daily basis. It appears simple to take the number of pages in the book and divide by 14 to know how far to read each day. But after day three or four, I start to lose track and do not want to continue recalculating where I should be.</p>

<p>Each time I start a new book, I create a new OmniFocus project for it. I have a series of tasks I complete after finishing a book. Since this project already exists, I took it to another level and added a “Read Book” group with subtasks for each day’s reading. With that group flagged, I know what today’s expected page count is by looking at <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/the-omnifocus-dashboard/">my Dashboard</a>.</p>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-medium" src="https://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts_extra/reading-books-on-a-schedule/read-book-group.png" /></p>

<p>But reading a book every two weeks means I create these tasks quite frequently. And you can’t expect me to do that manually every time, can you? A new script was in order.</p>

<p>When run, it asks four questions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>What is the title of the book?</li>
  <li>How many pages are in the book?</li>
  <li>When do you want to start reading?</li>
  <li>When do you want to finish reading?</li>
</ol>

<p>Using these answers, the script breaks the book into the correct number of tasks (one per day), each having the same number of pages to read. It adds these to my OmniFocus inbox so I can copy/paste or move them as I like. It programmatically adds @Read as a context, but the script can be altered as needed to fit your system. <a href="https://github.com/joebuhlig/OFScripts/tree/master/Read%20Book%20Tasks">This script</a> can be found in my <a href="https://github.com/joebuhlig/OFScripts">OFScripts repository on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>The result of this is a daily view of progress I need to make in order to hit my goal. Knowing the day’s goal forces me to make time and cut back on the less important, trivial actions.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/the-deception-of-working-on-a-system.jpeg" /><p>It’s a trap so easy to fall for: we find ourselves spending multiple hours fine-tuning, tweaking, and developing the simple structure that will automatically create more time and 3X our daily productivity.
<!--more--></p>

<p>If you’re new to productivity or systems, then giving yourself a couple days to put these processes in place may pay off big and be well worth your time. Even if you’re a pro it can be helpful to make adjustments to how you do things with the intent of increasing efficiency, meaning, and output. I make tweaks to my structure frequently. But I need to remind myself of a lie that creeps up when I embark on one of these system alteration endeavors: <em>this is productive.</em></p>

<p>False. It is not productive. It is <em>meta-productive.</em> It feels productive because we are doing something that has meaning; this will make me a better, more efficient person. We are given a sense that we will be able to do more and live a better life, no matter how small the impact, in the future. But it doesn’t inherently make us more productive. It makes it possible, but it won’t make it happen on its own. It simply sets up the environment to be the best it can or should be for us to act on.</p>

<p>This is where the “meta” part comes in. We are completing tasks that allow us to complete tasks more efficiently or effectively. It’s one step removed from the real work to which we’ve committed.</p>

<p>But the deception here is the sense of accomplishment that comes after we have been <em>meta-productive</em>. We’ve done the work necessary to make us better in the future and that gives us the feeling that something important has been completed - even though we haven’t touched one important task the whole time. We get excited about this new or updated system because we’ve made the decisions that will help us accomplish something new or something big. But we haven’t taken an action on the thing itself.</p>

<p>Don’t fall for this feeling of completion after you’ve worked on a system. Don’t celebrate until you’ve worked on the items within it.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/analog-writing-organization.jpeg" /><p>When I made the decision to <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/the-science-and-experience-of-analog-writing/">embrace pen and paper</a>, the need for structure quickly showed its face. I wanted my writing to live in a single notebook, but that meant I needed a method of tracking progress on pieces without thumbing through the whole notebook.
<!--more--></p>

<p>The logical conclusion here is an index which allows me to see each composition and the headway I’ve made. That progression consists of three steps which need to be incorporated in the indicator. First is the initial draft: the dump of the ideas at the onset. Second is the editing process of the first draft, and the final step is to transcribe the writing to the computer for one last look. Once it is moved from paper to screen, the tracking process is handled digitally.</p>

<p>In practice, this means I need a list of articles augmented with the location within the notebook and the progress I’ve made on it. A simple page number will do for the location, but I wanted an evolving indicator for the progress meter. And since there are only three states to track, I went for the slow build of a star: “/” → “X” → “*”.</p>

<p>When there is no indicator, I know I have made a commitment to the piece but haven’t started writing. The “/” tells me I’ve finished the first draft. The “X” tells me the editing process as been completed. And the final “*” is a picture of completion when the transcription is finished. Altogether, this is what it looks like:</p>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-medium" src="https://joebuhlig.com/assets/posts_extra/analog-writing-organization/index.jpeg" /></p>

<p>Now, I can take the first few pages of any notebook to create this index over the life of the notebook. I could also add page numbers to any grouping of paper I feel inclined to use. Throw on top of this my want for good fountain pen paper and I was certain I would need to hack together a custom notebook or make compromises. But that’s not the case.</p>

<p>I found the notebook, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=as_li_ss_tl?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=leuchtturm1917&amp;sprefix=leuchtturm1917%2Caps%2C166&amp;linkCode=ll2&amp;tag=joebuhlig-20">Leuchtturm</a>, that has all of these features plus a few I didn’t realize I wanted. They have a built-in index as well as page numbers. It’s high-quality paper and has dual bookmark ribbons, one for finding my index and one for the last used page. There’s even a slot in the back that acts as an inbox while I’m out and stickers to help with archiving the notebook. I haven’t made a decision about keeping these when I fill it, but having the ability to easily do so and knowing the quality of the notebook makes me consider long-term storage of my hand-written words. Though storage space will likely make my decision for me.</p>

<p>I’ve chosen their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Leuchtturm-Master-Notebook-Hardcover-Dotted/dp/B003ENUIKC?tag=joebuhlig-20">Master Dot Grid</a> notebook because it’s larger and keeps my pages clean. The bigger pages allow me to see more of the piece at one time and requires less page turning when dictating the words into a microphone. It also fits nicely into the computer slot in my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cocoon-Innovations-Backpack-Laptop-MCP3401BK/dp/B00LBYTMOY?tag=joebuhlig-20">backpack</a> which is perfect for writing ventures away from the house. I’m a big fan of the Dot Grid paper because it limits the markings on the page yet gives me a bit of structure to keep my words in line.</p>

<p>If you’re looking to write by hand and need an organizational structure for your writing, take a look at Leuchtturm. Their notebooks fit perfectly.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/the-overwhelm-inbox.jpeg" /><p>The purpose of my <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/inbox-consolidation/">inbox consolidation project</a> is to cut back on the number of places I go to make decisions about my “open loops”. Between feeds, social media, and our always-on expectations, it becomes a habit and struggle to keep up with the mass of apps and information thrown at us. My theory was to create an aggregated inbox via email that combines these potentially overwhelming sources of inputs. The hope was to build a system that helps me scale back on the time and impulse to repeatedly process these inboxes.
<!--more--></p>

<p>Using email as a base for this is the simplest solution since it can be connected to almost any service out there. Most systems already have an email notification system built-in. By turning these on, I go from repeatedly checking websites to see if anything is new to processing the important parts at a dedicated time. But not every source of new information has this ability. For me, the outstanding inputs are RSS feeds and social media.</p>

<p>For social media, I had to first be honest with myself. What do I really <em>need</em> to know about? I know that I <em>want</em> to keep up with more than I should so I’m immediately faced with scaling back. For the inputs that make the cut, I use <a href="https://ifttt.com">IFTTT</a> to send me an email about each item. For example, I have a rule that emails me when I am mentioned on Twitter:</p>

<p><a href="https://ifttt.com/view_embed_recipe/425773-send-twitter-mentions-to-email" target="_blank" class="embed_recipe embed_recipe-l_30" id="embed_recipe-425773"><img src="https://ifttt.com/recipe_embed_img/425773" alt="IFTTT Recipe: Send Twitter mentions to email connects twitter to gmail" width="370px" style="max-width:100%" /></a><script async="" type="text/javascript" src="//ifttt.com/assets/embed_recipe.js"></script></p>

<p>Another set of overwhelming inputs is the huge variety of articles that I want to read. It’s already a habit for me to send these to Pocket from any social media app or browser I’m using at the time. To funnel these from Pocket into my email, I’m again turning to IFTTT:</p>

<p><a href="https://ifttt.com/view_embed_recipe/425768-send-all-pocket-articles-to-email" target="_blank" class="embed_recipe embed_recipe-l_33" id="embed_recipe-425768"><img src="https://ifttt.com/recipe_embed_img/425768" alt="IFTTT Recipe: Send all Pocket articles to email connects pocket to gmail" width="370px" style="max-width:100%" /></a><script async="" type="text/javascript" src="//ifttt.com/assets/embed_recipe.js"></script></p>

<p>Now for the big one: RSS feeds. You can set up recipes to send new feed items to your email with IFTTT. However, I am subscribed to about 100 RSS feeds. That would require 100 recipes to make it work. No, thank you. Instead, I found a service (<a href="http://feed.informer.com">feed.informer.com</a>) that allows me to create a single RSS feed out of multiple feeds. In my case, I created two of these “digest” feeds that I then used in these recipes, which is a lot more comfortable. This has the added benefit of eliminating an app, Feedly, that I was previously using.</p>

<p><a href="https://ifttt.com/view_embed_recipe/425763-send-email-from-feed-digest" target="_blank" class="embed_recipe embed_recipe-l_27" id="embed_recipe-425763"><img src="https://ifttt.com/recipe_embed_img/425763" alt="IFTTT Recipe: Send email from feed digest connects feed to gmail" width="370px" style="max-width:100%" /></a><script async="" type="text/javascript" src="//ifttt.com/assets/embed_recipe.js"></script></p>

<p>Of course, it’s easy to see that this leads to a potentially enormous number of emails.  A fair amount of these can be deleted without opening them; I have everything I need to triage them in the subject line. But the key is to clear it out once daily. If I hold to that and avoid the temptation to check more often, I am given the freedom to spend more of my mental energy on important tasks. It also makes it easier to leave my phone somewhere other than my pocket or within reach at my desk.</p>

<p>The other, unintended, benefit of this has been visibility into the sheer volume of tiny bits of data that are available to us. We can easily consume thousands of pointless and potentially detrimental inputs that are better left unnoticed. Pulling all of these into one place provides a picture of information overwhelm that is catered specifically to you. I never realized how many sources of information I’ve tried to keep up with until now. It has led me to ruthlessly curate and cut back in ways I wish I had done sooner.</p>

<p>And as I expected, this is led me to change the purpose - and therefore layout - of my phone’s home screen for the better. But we’ll save that for another day:</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/editorial-as-a-database-viewer.jpeg" /><p>One habit that Evernote taught me was that of creating databases, collections of text and pictures that revolve around a specific topic or item. I’m yet to export my Evernote data into my <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/an-alternative-to-evernote/">alternative storage system</a> but I have solved my most glaring issue: searching and viewing these databases on iOS.
<!--more--></p>

<p>These consist of three data types: text, documents, and pictures. All text is created in markdown files. The documents are primarily PDFs and the pictures are… well they’re pictures. All of these files have a very simple organizational structure in DropBox. There’s a folder named after the type of database (Drinks), a subfolder if necessary (Coffee), and then the files which are named after the item itself (Caribou Mahogany.jpg). If there are pictures, documents, <em>and</em> text for the same item, they’ll get the same name (but with different file extensions) to make it easy to search.</p>

<p>It’s a very basic structure, which makes it easy to find and interact with these different files from different apps on iOS. My app of choice for text files is <a href="http://omz-software.com/editorial/">Editorial</a>. There’s a lot of power in Editorial that I’ve never utilized but I do know that it’s excellent for editing and reading markdown.</p>

<p>I was typing out a few sentences for an article while waiting for a friend when I accidentally tapped the name for a PDF within Editorial. To my surprise, I was given the ability to “Quick Look” the document within the app. I am not sure why I never tried this before but it singlehandedly changed my methods for interacting with these databases from a multi-app approach to a single point of access.</p>

<p>This means that given a file structure that works for you and a text-heavy implementation of databases, Editorial can act as a user interface similar to these catchall tools like Evernote. Yes, there is the downside of not being able to capture documents and pictures directly into Editorial. The trick is to capture these into DropBox and let Editorial be the viewer instead. But since my databases are primarily text, I’m able to leverage the power of a tool that was designed extensively for text and maintain the majority of my editing needs. Add to that the ability to view the extra files I compile and iOS now has a database interface I didn’t know I wanted.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/checklists-in-omnifocus.jpeg" /><p>Keeping different types of information in separate apps or systems is sometimes worth the extra infrastructure. But there is also a lot of value and mental freedom in using an existing process for multiple forms of data.
<!--more--></p>

<p>When you have a tool as flexible and powerful as OmniFocus, it gets easier to combine needs into one database. That is why I originally <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/using-omnifocus-for-somedaymaybe-lists/">moved my Someday/Maybe lists</a> into OmniFocus. The simplicity of having a single place for active <em>and</em> potential tasks eliminated a bit of resistance to capturing an idea. This ease was also my rationale for moving my <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/recurring-checklists-in-evernote/">checklists from Evernote</a> to OmniFocus.</p>

<p>There are a lot of ways to keep checklists in OmniFocus, but I keep the process as effortless as possible. I manage a single folder that holds all of them. I don’t have so many that I feel the need to subdivide them. They are all together in one list and each checklist has the same settings:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Parallel project set to “Complete when completing last action”</li>
  <li>Repeat set to Defer Again in one minute</li>
</ul>

<p>When I sit down to go through a checklist, I work from the project view so it doesn’t matter if the project is Parallel or Sequential. I see every item on the list regardless. My default for new projects is Parallel so I leave it alone. I want these to autocomplete and recreate themselves when everything is done; the repeat and completion settings make it happen.</p>

<p>I’ve used checklists for packing lists, payroll, and even rituals for quite a while. But during a recent Weekly Review I realized I was putting a handful of checklists elsewhere and treating them differently when I shouldn’t. The lists of steps for all my reviews has been living in my Guidance folder, so I flagged them to display on my Dashboard.</p>

<p>This is a prime example of how fluid a GTD system can be. It needs to fluctuate with how you work and morph as you learn about yourself. I very recently wrote about how I work with my <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/the-omnifocus-dashboard/">OmniFocus Dashboard</a>. And here I am changing its purpose entirely. I realized I had abstracted and complicated these meta-lists unnecessarily. Yes, they are Guidance projects to complete at regular intervals, but those intervals are better placed on the calendar and the checklist put where they belong. By breaking them off into their own category, I was required to maintain another level of the structure. If I can simplify it and uphold my level of productivity while eliminating mental strain (no matter how small), why wouldn’t I reduce the complexity? This is especially true when the work required to pull it off is miniscule.</p>

<p>All of this is to say that I’ve moved my reviews into my checklists folder and pulled them from the Dashboard. I reserve time on my calendar for them and go through the list at that time. It cuts back on the automation going into my daily task list and gives me the freedom to put off a review for a few hours or days if I need to go heads down on a project. It also eliminates some of the overwhelm from seeing a Dashboard with 30+ items on it in the morning.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/inbox-consolidation.jpg" /><p>As part of a new project that will be released in a few weeks, I recently reread <em>Getting Things Done</em> by David Allen. I found it interesting that David hasn’t changed his tune when it comes to information overload. Despite a dramatic increase in technology and the volume of inputs as compared to the original writing, he still advocates for the same capture mechanisms and clarification process.
<!--more--></p>

<p>This is to be expected but reading his thoughts on the subject of social media struck a chord with me. I have long considered Twitter, piles on my desk, and the bench in my woodshop as inboxes. Developing an awareness of where “open loops” collect is a process that reveals a large number of inboxes we may not realize we have. And when we consider the number of apps we use that have an “in” feature, this number can explode. Unless we do something about it we’ll spend all our time clearing our trays, and as soon as we get through them once, we’ll need to start over again. The easy and obvious solution here is to cut back on inputs and create “aggregate inboxes” or places that pull captured items from multiple sources.</p>

<p>Cutting back is the best alternative here, but often times we can’t do this or don’t want to. So the next option is to create consolidated inboxes. I like to think of these as smart inboxes. We may not be able to pull everything into a single inbox but the fewer places that need cleared, the better.</p>

<p>And to be honest, I don’t want everything in one inbox. And I don’t need to process all my inboxes at the same intervals. My voice mails need cleared out multiple times a day, but that pile on the bench in my woodshop only needs clearing when I want to make sawdust. That means my aggregate inboxes can’t be consolidated beyond my clarification frequencies.</p>

<p>Let’s take email for example. Like most, I have multiple email addresses. Whenever I process email (which is way too often), I prefer to take care of all my emails at once. So I pull everything into a single, master email account on Gmail. That allows me to see every new email and act on it from one place.</p>

<p>On my phone, I group all social media accounts into a single folder. I can check them all at once (again, too often) instead of bouncing in and out of them individually. It can become a check pit if I don’t group them.</p>

<p>Although I have done some of this aggregation already, I’m now trying to further the automated consolidation and looking for ways to cut back on physical inboxes. The easier of these are the physical inboxes. I need to notice and combine them to cut back on the number of collection points. The digital side is more treacherous. It’s too easy to draw the conclusion of auto-forwarding all emails or Twitter mentions into OmniFocus. If you’re a social media manager, that might be a good idea. But as a writer and developer, that would be detrimental to my daily work. I would quickly develop a habit of clearing my OmniFocus inbox every 10 minutes.</p>

<p>The better solution might be my existing email account. If I’m already strictly limiting my time in email, that could easily be a better place to send these inputs. And if I can craft the format of the email in a way that enables a quick decision or even an automated decision then my information overwhelm can slowly dissipate. At least, that is the hope.</p>

<p>So the idea here is to bring all digital inputs created by someone other than myself into my email. That sounds a bit scary at first, but if that single inbox can help me cut back on the growing number of digital places to clear, allow me to remain on top of those inputs, and limit the mental strain of multiple collection points, I have succeeded.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/intentional-gtd-titles.jpeg" /><p>When I started with GTD five years ago, I was certain it was the missing piece to my mental overwhelm puzzle. It was the five-step framework that would keep me from procrastinating and give me the motivation to accomplish everything to which I kept saying yes.
<!--more--></p>

<p>And although these are possible outcomes, they are far from implicit. GTD can help you stay on task and give you the means to work on the right next action, but not without your discipline and persistence. And then it only works if you do all of the thinking about a task or project when it is initially processed. Take these projects for example:</p>

<p><strong>Wife’s birthday</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Cake</li>
  <li>Present</li>
  <li>Plates and silverware</li>
  <li>Invite friends</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>example.com</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Complete web design</li>
  <li>Decide on host</li>
  <li>Email?</li>
  <li>Launch date?</li>
  <li>Commerce section</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>New product</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Photos for website</li>
  <li>Quality across lines</li>
  <li>Market?</li>
  <li>Retailers</li>
  <li>Press release</li>
</ul>

<p>At first glance, these may seem fine. I have a list of projects and a list of tasks that go with each project. But you may see a glaring issue here; there’s still some interpretation necessary to decide what each requires you to do. Is “plates and silverware” a reminder to set the table or is it part of your shopping list? Are you asking about the addition of email addresses to the website or the set up for an email newsletter? Does “press release” mean you need to write it, publish it, or review it? Granted, some of the detail missing here may be implied depending on the context assigned to each. If “plates and silverware” has the @Errands context, you have your answer.</p>

<p>But the projects themselves leave you in question as well. Do you have a shopping list for your wife’s birthday or a list of setup that needs to happen on the day itself? Are you writing the code for the website or overseeing the project? Are you exploring the addition of a new product for your company or is it a new thing you’re exploring personally? Again, some of this may be implied through the metadata you assigned but the title itself is still lacking. This set of projects leaves a lot of questions and requires you to decode a series of assumptions before you can take action.</p>

<p>Part of the <em>why</em> of GTD is to eliminate the need to hold information in our minds since we are terrible at recalling it when we need it. But we inevitably develop a need to remember our intent for these projects and tasks if we treat them as nothing more than a list of triggers. We’ve left ourselves with only half of the thinking completed and retain the other half in our minds, which defeats the goal we originally set out to achieve. We better serve ourselves if we finish the process and put all of the data we need or have for the item in the name.</p>

<p>That naturally begs the question, “how <em>should</em> you name them?”” The answer is simple in principle and challenging in practice. These titles should tell you exactly what needs to be done without the need to augment it with information you are still trying to remember. From a tactical standpoint, that means starting with a verb and giving so much detail that you can wake up in the middle of the night and still know what to do when you read it.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Wife’s birthday → <em>Celebrate wife’s birthday at home</em></li>
  <li>example.com → <em>Build example.com for client xyz</em></li>
  <li>New product → <em>Launch new line of sweatshirts</em></li>
</ul>

<p>By renaming these projects, you instantly see an increase in clarity and you know what <em>done</em> is just by reading the title. It takes more work up front to give this level of definition, but I can tell you from experience that those extra few seconds will save you the time and hassle of rethinking them each time in the future.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cake → <em>Call Deli re: custom cake for wife’s birthday party</em></li>
  <li>Email? → <em>Email client xyz re: how many email accounts are needed prior to launch?</em></li>
  <li>Press release → <em>Write first draft of online press release for new line of sweatshirts</em></li>
</ul>

<p>It’s no small task to spell out this much detail, but the benefits are invaluable. Instead of seeing a few words that require interpretation (which becomes a task itself), I see an action to be taken. Eliminating that miniscule amount of resistance can be the difference between productive work and procrastination. Don’t let a desire to save time up front create an excuse to do nothing later.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/the-science-and-experience-of-analog-writing.jpeg" /><p>I began <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/writing-articles-by-hand/">hand writing articles</a> with a lot of skepticism mixed with hope. I didn’t know what to expect but I wanted a positive outcome. As much as I lean toward an integration of technology in every aspect of my work, I felt a sense that paper had benefits I had never understood.
<!--more--></p>

<p>I committed to writing five articles by hand, but after the first three I realized there was something powerful happening during the process of putting words on physical paper. It was like I had discovered a well of untapped resources within my mind that could only be used when analog tools were the chosen medium. And no matter how much I reflected and searched myself for the reasoning behind this, I couldn’t find the answer without searching for neurological science comparing pen and paper to the keyboard.</p>

<h2 id="brain-organization">Brain Organization</h2>

<p>I learned that it all starts with how our brains organize modes of thinking. It’s common knowledge that there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_hemisphere">two hemispheres</a> in our brains and that they operate in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_brain#Lateralization">transposed manner</a>. The left brain controls the right side of the body and the right brain controls the left side of the body. We also know that modes of thinking occur on one side or the other. The left brain is known as the analytical brain because it controls the mathematical, logical, and scientific modes of thinking while the right brain - known as the creative brain - controls creativity, music, and imagination. The skills required to write (language, speech, and linear thinking) are found in the left brain.</p>

<h2 id="brain-dominance">Brain Dominance</h2>

<p>Each of us has one side of our brain that is more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateralization_of_brain_function">dominant</a> than the other. And the level of dominance is different for everyone. In part, this is why we find such a diversity of personalities and skill sets. Sometimes there’s a strong dominance, other times it’s hardly noticeable. Regardless of the level of dominance, this side of the brain reveals itself in your strengths. A left brain dominant person is likely to be a math whiz, analytical, and following a career in the sciences. Someone who is right brain dominant has a tendency to be good at relationships, art, and visualization. These are not hard rules, but guidelines and stereotypes. I’ve known that I’m an analytical person for a long time, which means I’m left brain dominant.</p>

<h2 id="hand-dominance">Hand Dominance</h2>

<p>With rare exception, we all primarily use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handedness">one hand</a> or the other to write. How we develop or choose a specific hand for this task is genetic, but has cultural influences as well. The whole picture of how this comes about is still unclear, but whichever hand you write with is typically your dominant hand. And for most of us (90%), that dominance is found in our right hand.</p>

<h2 id="dominance-correlation">Dominance Correlation</h2>

<p>Things get interesting when you correlate brain and hand dominance. Being left brain dominant does not make you right-handed. Nor does being right brain dominant make you left-handed. But when you are left-handed, the right brain is controlling your writing hand and vice versa. So left-handers are using the creative brain when writing and right-handers are using the analytical brain. And since we know that language, speech, and linear thinking come from the left (analytical) brain, right-handers, like myself, are naturally engaging the portion of their mind that allows them to formulate words and sentences.</p>

<p>Obviously, this is not to say that left-handers cannot write well. The brain is much more complex than that. But generally speaking, it might explain some of the stigma around teaching left-handed children to write. It’s possible that it doesn’t come as naturally to them as drawing or creating art.</p>

<h2 id="the-keyboard">The Keyboard</h2>

<p>The physical process of typing is much different than using a pen. Writing on paper is primarily a one-handed task. Your off hand may be busy keeping paper aligned or holding a pen cap, but the main work is being completed with one hand. Contrast that with the keyboard. The keyboard is designed for both hands, which is partially why it’s much faster to type than write.</p>

<p>By using both hands to type, we engage both sides of our brain more fully. That is not altogether a bad thing, but it does mean that we aren’t focusing on one mode of thinking. We’re switching from linear, language thinking to spatial, emotional thinking and back again. Some people are better with this dissonance than others, which is why some say there is no difference between typing and writing by hand. I personally struggle with this neurological bouncing during the writing process. But when I pick up a pen I can trace a thought and explore it without all the mental jumping around.</p>

<h2 id="studies">Studies</h2>

<p>There’s a growing body of science exploring the comparison between hand writing and typing. Researchers have shown that writing lecture notes by hand gives students an edge over their typing peers. We know that kids with and without handwriting disabilities are able to write more when using a pen than when using a computer. There’s even a study from 1987 that hints at a potential influence on writing when done from a computer. If you <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=pen+paper+writing+vs+computer">search Google Scholar</a> for “pen paper writing versus computer” you’ll have more than enough material to keep you busy for a while. But here are a few of the resources I found interesting when I began my exploration:</p>

<h2 id="my-experience">My Experience</h2>

<p>To say that I’ve enjoyed the process of writing by hand would be an understatement. Some of the benefits I was expecting did become a reality. By taking longer to write by hand I am able to formulate my thoughts more clearly and fully; I feel better about what I’ve written when I’m done. But going further than just quality of words, I’ve discovered a few other benefits and one glaring downside.</p>

<h3 id="distraction">Distraction</h3>

<p>As I expected, I’m not nearly as distracted with paper as I am with the computer. And it is primarily due to availability. Because it is so easy to take a quick peek at Twitter, I don’t stay on task nearly as well on the computer. Pen and paper affords me only one thing to do: put words on a page. It naturally allows me to focus on the task at hand.</p>

<h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>

<p>Previously I had to put tricks in place to bring myself to write. I’ve always enjoyed the accomplishment of having written, but the process itself has always felt like a burden. I had to write in the morning, my most alert time of the day, to focus enough to write. It was the only way to get it done. But when I started exploring analog writing, I discovered an innate interest in pulling out the paper. Most of the tricks and timing are unnecessary. There’s joy in inking a fountain pen, opening a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Leuchtturm-Master-Notebook-Hardcover-Dotted/dp/B003ENUIKC?tag=joebuhlig-20">quality notebook</a>, and laying words on the page that allows me to write more without it being a hardship.</p>

<h3 id="time">Time</h3>

<p>Here’s the downside. It takes longer and that’s for two reasons. One, it takes longer to write by hand than it does to type. That comes with the positive of higher quality but it’s still a hit to the efficiency I had with typing. Second, I write longer articles when writing by hand. I spell out more detail and develop thoughts more fully. Again, I see this as a positive, but it means I need to be willing to cut time elsewhere.</p>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

<p>I’ve always felt that writing was synonymous with typing. “That’s how it <em>should</em> be done. It’s faster and more efficient.” But for me, the trade-offs aren’t worth it. I’ll be sticking with pen and paper. I’ve even gone to the extent of setting up a dedicated writing desk and purchasing a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Leuchtturm-Master-Notebook-Hardcover-Dotted/dp/B003ENUIKC?tag=joebuhlig-20">special notebook</a> for it.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/guest-posting.jpeg" /><p>Over the past month I’ve made some design changes and layout alterations here on the site. Some of that was purely for aesthetics and ease of use, but it also included some back-end alterations to allow guest posting. I’ve debated this for a long time and I’m finally ready to pull the trigger.
<!--more--></p>

<p><strong>You can read the details about how to participate on the <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/guest">guest posting page</a>.</strong></p>

<p>One of the best ways to expand our thinking is to explore new ideas and perspectives that may differ from our own. It forces us to formulate our own opinions on the subject. We may love the thought or think it’s trash but either way, making that decision helps us understand our own reasoning behind the subject. By allowing others to write articles for this site, we can see glimpses of how others operate and think, which broadens the perspective on productivity conveyed here.</p>

<p>This also frees up some of my own time. I really like the current posting cadence, but I’m looking to direct some of my writing time to new areas. I have a couple important projects I’m working on that I want to dedicate more time to and I know there will be more projects when those are complete. Guest posting will allow the rhythm to continue and these new areas to accelerate.</p>

<p>I can continue listing reasons why I think this is a good thing, but you get the point. There’s a lot of value that can come to all of us. So if you’re interested in sharing your thoughts and words with readers like yourself (even if you’ve never written an article before), check out the details on the <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/guest">guest posting page</a>.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/alternating-types-of-tasks.jpeg" /><p>There’s something liberating about putting a name to something you didn’t understand. This was my exact experience when I learned I am ADHD. It gave me words to explain the way I think and those words have given way to a deeper comprehension of how I operate.
<!--more--></p>

<p>Putting a name to it also makes it easier to connect with people in the same boat. And it makes it possible to learn what others do to take advantage of the positives and overcome the negatives. So naturally, I did some research and found that many try to eradicate it entirely. It’s seen as a disease to overcome. But you may be doing yourself an injustice by trying to delete a portion of who you are. I would rather heighten the useful aspects and downplay the detrimental. If I have an overactive mind, is there a way to allow myself to bounce from thing to thing and still accomplish my creative work? After a bit of experimentation, I’ve discovered a way to do this.</p>

<p>I can only will myself to focus on a new task for about 20 minutes - unless I’m really excited or interested in it, then it can be days before I come up for air. But when I’m not in hyperfocus mode, 20 minutes is about all I have.</p>

<p>For a long time I’ve been breaking my projects down into 15 - 20 minute tasks. My focus-ability may be why I’ve done that but I can’t say for certain. Typically, I would sit down and work on a project with the intent of completing three or four of these tasks. And I’ve had fairly good success doing so. But it’s never occurred to me that this was a bad idea. It’s what everyone else does and they seem to have a great success with it. Why shouldn’t I follow suit?</p>

<p>Learning that I am ADHD gave me the clarity I needed to explore other options. If I can naturally focus on a task for 20 minutes, what if I started a completely different type of task afterwards instead of doing more of the same? What if I alternate between coding, writing, learning, and admin every 20 minutes?</p>

<p>Bingo! It turns out that I’ve wanted to work this way all along, but I couldn’t see it. Yes, there are times when I get into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">flow</a> and won’t switch. If I can focus for longer, why move on? But if I can’t focus, I don’t fight it. I switch to a different type of task and come back at the next switch off. After all, I tend the bounce quickly. Why not take advantage of it?</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/what-to-review.jpeg" /><p>The longer I practice GTD principles, the more intentional I try to be with the time I spend updating my systems. I need my commitments to be thought through and my decisions to be made ahead of time. Knowing that I am prone to starting new projects before I have time for them leads me to a need for a recurring time of reevaluation.
<!--more--></p>

<p>David Allen declares the Weekly Review a vital component of the framework. And I would agree that this once-weekly update is a <em>make it or break it</em> step to success. Without it, I would have a growing list of stalled projects that should be dropped, or at least moved to a Someday/Maybe list. But I’ve also found other levels of review to be beneficial. And those are better done at different intervals than the Weekly Review. It’s not worth my time to evaluate each context and project every morning. I would spend the vast majority of my time in reflection and never accomplish the tasks I’m reviewing.</p>

<p>The glaring question here is “What do you actually do during these reviews?” The easy thing to do is share a picture of my checklists, but that fails to explain the reasoning for the review itself. You are free to copy these, but be sure to think through your intent and understand why you are doing it before you tweak these to fit your personality. There’s potentially more harm in aimlessly going through these than in skipping them altogether.</p>

<h2 id="daily-review-20-mins">Daily Review (~20 mins)</h2>

<p>The first step in GTD is Capture. It all starts with the habit of putting tasks and ideas into an inbox. My problem is that without daily time for making a decision about each item, inboxes perpetually grow. At the same time, I struggle to jump start my day. Despite the system, I’m drawn to the most urgent or interesting thing on my mind and want to focus on it first thing in the morning. To combat this I set up the Daily Review with the purpose of clearing inboxes and creating motivation on the right task.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Process Inbox: Paper</li>
  <li>Process Inbox: Email</li>
  <li>Process Inbox: Drafts</li>
  <li>Process Inbox: Browser</li>
  <li>Process Inbox: DropBox</li>
  <li>Process Inbox: OmniFocus</li>
  <li>Review @Waiting For</li>
  <li>Review Forecast</li>
  <li>Review Calendar</li>
  <li>Review Weekly Plan</li>
  <li>Review Completed</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="weekly-review-70-mins">Weekly Review (~70 mins)</h2>

<p>The core purpose of my Weekly Review is to be honest with myself and verify that I’m headed in the right direction. I’m terrible at getting a feel for this and can easily get off track in the course of an afternoon. My tendency is to put off projects that are no fun or that have a daunting next action. I need to limit the projects and tasks available to pick from. I also need to review projects that aren’t moving and ask myself why they are stalled.</p>

<p>I should note that the tasks on this checklist look deceptively simple, but they’re far from it. <em>Clear Review Perspective</em> is a 30 minute or longer task that forces me to decide if I’m going to keep the project in the active queue, put it on hold, or drop it entirely. <em>Review Stalled Projects</em> makes me look at projects I keep thinking I’ll work on but continue failing to follow through on. These two steps alone can sometimes take an hour. But if I skipped that hour of commitment reevaluation, I’ll spend weeks working on fluff that takes me nowhere.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Process Inbox: @Joe in Kitchen</li>
  <li>Clear Review Perspective</li>
  <li>Review Stalled Projects</li>
  <li>Set Weekly Plan</li>
  <li>Weekly Reflection</li>
  <li>Clean Workstation</li>
  <li>Empty Trash</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="monthly-review-30-mins">Monthly Review (~30 mins)</h2>

<p>It’s impossible to validate my direction in the Weekly Review if I don’t have goals and a mission by which these projects are guided. The simple purpose of my Monthly Review is to create guidance and help me design my days to realize these goals. I look over my Horizons of Focus and make sure I have a sense of direction for the upcoming months and years. Granted, I’m always revising this. But it’s this process of reading and altering the plan that allows me to course correct quickly.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Review 50,000</li>
  <li>Review 40,000</li>
  <li>Review 30,000</li>
  <li>Check Old Projects</li>
  <li>Evaluate Morning Ritual</li>
  <li>Evaluate Evening Ritual</li>
  <li>Evaluate Daily Schedule</li>
  <li>Evaluate Contexts</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="annual-review-3-hrs">Annual Review (~3 hrs)</h2>

<p>I’ve found some value in rethinking the basic aspects of how we as a family operate once a year. Those can include insurance and savings, but they should also encompass your goals as a family or couple. And they do not need to be done all at once or alone. Involve your spouse and kids if you have them. But remember that your tolerance for this type of thinking than may be much higher (or lower) than your spouse’s. Break it up across a few weeks if you need.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Becky: Big accomplishments in the past year?</li>
  <li>Becky: Big goals for the next year?</li>
  <li>Becky: Evaluate financial state</li>
  <li>Becky: Evaluate insurance state</li>
  <li>Determine monthly goals for next year</li>
</ul>

<p>Again, this amount of review may be overkill for you. As long as your system helps you drive down the right road, you’re golden. But there are always times when we need to reference the lines on the road to keep us from hitting the ditches, and some of us need more reference points than others to stay on the road.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/hazel-keeping-omnifocus-updated.jpg" /><p>There are times when you need a feature in software that doesn’t currently exist. Sometimes that leads to exploring alternatives or even creating your own, which is how inventors and entrepreneurs get a lot of their ideas.
<!--more--></p>

<p>In our current app culture, there is a growing push for extensibility and the ability to interact with the core data of a service from other apps. This ability has become necessary in my core applications. I’ve reached a point where there are no apps out there that have <em>all</em> the features I’m looking for.</p>

<p>I don’t see this as a bad thing. It simply means my view of software and my willingness to augment the existing functionality reaches beyond the current options. This does not mean an app is the wrong choice. Basically, I’m asking for things that either don’t exist in any current app, such as <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/32/">shuffling tasks</a>, or it means that the developer has yet to implement them.</p>

<p>With something as personal as a task manager, we’re certain to find shortcomings in every option available. Some people decide to work within the system they’ve chosen while others search for and create structures to fill in the gaps with new, bolt-on features. Again, this doesn’t mean you’ve chosen the wrong tool. It means you understand yourself and the app well enough to develop a system that is specific to you.</p>

<p>I’ve done this feature augmentation with OmniFocus. The Omni Group is excellent at making their apps scriptable and they have zero intentions of changing that. This is only <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/why-i-use-omnifocus/">one of the reasons</a> I’ve made OmniFocus my life manager of choice. They understand the impossibility of creating a tool that fits everyone, so they make it possible for us to customize our experience.</p>

<p>The experience I’ve created on my Mac has a hands-off mentality. I’ve written a handful of AppleScripts to create features I rely on. I could run these daily or every time I want to my database to update, but here’s a better solution: <a href="https://www.noodlesoft.com/kb/">Hazel</a>.</p>

<p>Hazel has the ability to run a script when a certain criteria has been met. That criteria is extremely flexible and has allowed me to fine-tune this new functionality. The following is an overview of these augmented features that Hazel has allowed me to add to OmniFocus without any manual interventions.</p>

<h2 id="auto-parser">Auto-Parser</h2>

<p>There has been <a href="https://discourse.omnigroup.com/t/implementation-details-for-omnifocus-2-14-automation/24179?u=joebuhlig">great progress</a> on this in recent weeks but I often have a desire to capture an idea and send it to a specific project and context from my phone. I could use the new URL scheme but it’s not as quick and smooth as using the <a href="https://github.com/joebuhlig/OFScripts/tree/master/Auto-Parser">Auto-Parser</a>. I’ve written about this <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/omnifocus-auto-parser/">in the past</a>, but the short of it is that it allows me to email a task into OmniFocus and let my Mac put it into the correct home within my database. I let Hazel run this script in the background every time OmniFocus syncs.</p>

<h2 id="scheduled-reviews">Scheduled Reviews</h2>

<p>Some people love the ability to do daily “mini-reviews” in order to keep their projects updated. I prefer to do them all at once and on scheduled days. Since OmniFocus doesn’t currently support this, I wrote <a href="https://github.com/joebuhlig/OFScripts/tree/master/Update%20Reviews">this script</a> which resets the “Next Review Date” to my scheduled date depending on the review cycle I have set for that project. I used to run this manually whenever I saw the perspective highlight but now I let Hazel run it (without the confirmation) on a daily basis.</p>

<h2 id="weather-activation">Weather Activation</h2>

<p>Sometimes I add features that I feel should be a part of the core software, like scheduled reviews. This is far from that. I wanted to turn projects on or off depending on weather conditions, namely temperature. <a href="https://github.com/joebuhlig/OFScripts/tree/master/Weather%20Activation">This script</a> does exactly that. Again, I let Hazel run it daily and it searches for projects with notes that meet a certain criteria. Based on the results, it decides if the project should be made active or not. This is really handy for spring and fall maintenance projects.</p>

<h2 id="text-file-report">Text File Report</h2>

<p>I generate a daily report that shows all the tasks I’ve completed that day. It gives me a historical record that I can use for clients, but mostly I just like to be able to look back on a certain day and see what I did. It’s not necessary but I like the satisfaction in seeing it. <a href="https://github.com/joebuhlig/OFScripts/tree/master/Daily%20Task%20Report">This script</a> takes the tasks completed yesterday and puts them into a text file. Hazel runs it daily to give me a single file for each day.</p>

<p>Although I would love to see these features built-in, I understand they are too specific to my preferences and a broader implementation would add too much to an already intimidating and powerful tool.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/writing-articles-by-hand.jpeg" /><p>After reflecting on the process of <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/22/">writing a daily schedule by hand</a> and discussing <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/33/">the benefits of the analog over the digital</a>, I’ve decided to try writing articles with pen and paper.
<!--more--></p>

<p>I’ve accrued a variety of theories for why I should to this, but ultimately, I’m curious to know if there are any benefits of analog writing tools for someone who writes for the web. Even contemplating this makes me think it’s a crazy idea. Why use pen and paper when typing is so much faster? And wasn’t typing speed part of the rationale behind my <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/dvorak-transition/">Dvorak transition</a>? On both counts, yes.</p>

<p>And to be honest, I hope to return to typing them. But my curiosity won’t leave me alone. I cannot help but wonder if the physical process of putting ink on a page has benefits I’m unaware of. I can speculate what those may be, but until I give it a real and genuine attempt, I’ll never be able to let the idea go.</p>

<p>It is all the unknowns surrounding the process that has me writing this away from all screens with fountain pen in hand. Will the slower pace lead me to clearer thoughts and better phrasing of my ideas? Is there a deeper satisfaction in the writing process? Does a pen help me focus more than a keyboard? My presumed answer to all of these questions is yes. If the quality of my articles goes up as a result and the extra time is available, then it is certainly worth the extra effort. And if that’s the case, why can’t this mode of thinking and way of writing be duplicated through a keyboard?</p>

<p>My normal writing environment is in <em>Distraction Free Mode</em> inside Sublime Text. It’s nothing more than full screen mode with all display panels hidden. The theory should hold that I’m writing in the same environment as analog: with no outside distraction or tendencies to deviate from the task at hand. But one major difference remains with the availability of distractions. There are easily more opportunities to jump in and out of alternatives on the Mac. So in theory, the analog process should yield greater focus.</p>

<p>My hope is that the slower pace allows me to process and develop my thoughts more completely. Too often I reread an article I released a few days prior and see a gaping hole in my rationale. Or I’ll see a point that I touched on but could have spelled out in more detail. My brevity isn’t wrong, per se, but I would prefer to put it all out there in most cases. My shortness is due to a lack of decision more than a set intention. I don’t want to hold back without realizing I’ve done so. I know the slower pace of hand writing my articles will have an impact, but is it a noticeable and valuable difference?</p>

<p>I am also tempted to think that the overall process of writing an article will be faster. As much as I like to think that typing can be done distraction-free and focused, I have to confess to “checking in” when I have a pause in words. By stepping away from the screen entirely, those “just checks” and the time they take should disappear and allow me to develop a better phrase instead of defaulting to my original and often predictable way of stating the idea.</p>

<p>I’ve committed to writing five articles by hand - this being the first - so I have four to go. It doesn’t sound like a lot but I’m fairly certain it won’t take long to draw a conclusion. I will give it my best try and explore the results because, as usual, my curiosity has gotten the better of me.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/Creating-a-Personal-Book-Index.jpeg" /><p>I used to just pick up a book, start at the beginning, and read it to the end. I tried not to bend any pages and always used a bookmark to make sure the book still looked brand new when I was finished. I had an unwarranted fear of ruining my books because I held them in such high regard.
<!--more--></p>

<p>I think that does the author an injustice. Yes, we’re reading the book. But are we doing anything with what we’re reading? Are we thoroughly comprehending it and engaging with the content? For me, the answer to those was “No”. Sure, I would learn a few things, but most of the time I found myself skimming the whole thing trying to find a section with the solution I was looking for or an <em>aha moment</em> to teach me something new.</p>

<p>After reading this way for a long time I eventually started underlining or highlighting passages I found interesting or inspiring. That was a big step for me. But those words, despite having an impact on me, would eventually be lost. I might remember reading something in a specific book and then go back and look for it but this rarely happened.</p>

<p>While reading <a href="http://now.joebuhlig.com/reading">my latest books</a> I started creating my own index of these highlights at the prompting of <a href="http://fourhourworkweek.com/2014/10/21/brain-pickings/">Tim Ferris and Maria Popova</a>. I wasn’t sure if it would be worth it or not, but I can now say that being able to glance at the back of a book to see the location of these important passages makes it a much better experience and well worth the extra seconds it takes to create it.</p>

<p>What I’m doing is simple. When I underline or highlight some text, I go to the back of the book where there are always a couple blank pages, create a topic heading or find one that already exists, and I add the page number of the text I just underlined. Done.</p>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-small" src="/assets/posts_extra/creating-a-personal-book-index/book-index.jpg" /></p>

<p>When I’m finished reading the book, I do my best to write a quick overview for myself in a text file. As part of that process, I transcribe this book index into a digital format at the bottom of the review. This makes it possible to search for topics and see the books I’ve read that pertained to that topic. It also allows me to see what pages in the book pertain to that topic.</p>

<p>The searching piece is just icing on the cake, though. To me the real joy is having that personalized index at the back of the book to thumb through. I know that if there’s something that struck me in the book, I can always get back to it quickly and easily.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/Is-Dvorak-Worth-It.jpg" /><p>After almost three months of typing with a <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/dvorak-transition/">Dvorak keyboard</a>, I’ve reached some conclusions about this QWERTY alternative. Like most comparisons of this nature there are some significant pros and cons between the two. But I don’t think it’s fair to draw any conclusions until you’ve experienced both sides.
<!--more--></p>

<p>My conclusion: <strong>I’m sticking with Dvorak</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="speed">Speed</h2>

<p>One of the main reasons given for using Dvorak is typing speed. Because the layout is designed to limit finger travel, the theory is that you can hit the keys much more quickly and create words faster. There are a lot of studies refuting this rationale and I don’t know what the real answer is when you look at the best of the best in each group. But I do know my own results are quite conclusive. When I started this journey I was typing 72 WPM on QWERTY. Today I’m averaging 84 WPM on Dvorak. Again, this is after only three months. And since the majority of my work is done by typing, this leads to potential gains for me even if they are small.</p>

<h2 id="keyboards">Keyboards</h2>

<p>One drawback of going with Dvorak is access to the physical keyboards needed to make it work. Yes, you can learn it and use a QWERTY keyboard to type Dvorak. But I find that having <a href="http://www.amazon.com/KB-Covers-DV-M-CB-2-Dvorak-keyboard/dp/B00NCD1UZ6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1461856193&amp;sr=8-1&amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;tag=joebuhlig-20&amp;linkId=ada498e9c149e95d19118e594db94578">a cover</a> on top makes it a lot easier. There are a times when most typists glance even slightly at the keys for reference. Having the actual key displayed can have a big impact. I use a cover that fits both my MacBook Pro and the Apple Wireless Keyboard since those are the two I use. That is an added expense to consider here.</p>

<h2 id="multiple-users">Multiple Users</h2>

<p>My wife uses my primary machine from time to time and that means she needs QWERTY to remain available. What I’ve found is that it’s really a non-issue. You can set the layout on each profile and once logged in it will always goes back to that layout. Even when switching users on the lock screen it changes the layout. I sometimes need to use QWERTY from the lock screen but that’s the only time it’s an issue. My wife never has to deal with it.</p>

<h2 id="rsi">RSI</h2>

<p>I wouldn’t say that I have RSI but I do know when I’ve had a heavy typing day. For me that usually means typing 4,000 words in a day or more. I’ve had a few days when I hit 7,000 and my hands really need a break afterwards. I don’t have any data behind it but I know that since the switch I’ve had a couple 5,000+ days and I didn’t realize it until I saw the numbers later. I normally would have felt it at that level. To me, that’s a good indicator of positive long-term results.</p>

<h2 id="ios">iOS</h2>

<p>On iOS I find my biggest complaint. There is no built-in Dvorak keyboard so I end up using a third-party keyboard. But there are still times when those keyboards aren’t allowed or won’t show up reliably. Searching in Spotlight or typing in passwords are the biggest culprits I’ve found. So there are still times when I’m using QWERTY on iOS but I don’t always know when I’ll be required to do so. I would love for Apple to add this to their built-in options.</p>

<h2 id="retaining-qwerty">Retaining QWERTY</h2>

<p>There are still times when I’ve found myself using another computer or device. The tech and sound booth at our church is the most common one. But I also use my wife’s profile once in a while. So I still find myself typing on a QWERTY keyboard from time to time. I did a quick test out of curiosity and found that I’m still at 45 WPM on QWERTY. It’s nowhere near my original speed but that’s to be expected. I’m alright with where I am, but I’m not actively trying to keep it around.</p>

<p>In the end, I’m quite happy with the transition and benefits I’m seeing with Dvorak. And since I’ve only been at it a short time, I can only hope that the positives continue to surface, my speed continues increasing, and the strain on my hands remains limited.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/Using-the-Analog-to-Grasp-the-Digital.jpeg" /><p>I’m guilty of looking for ways to accomplish tasks on the computer long before it crosses my mind to try paper or the whiteboard. It’s almost embarrassing sometimes. The idea of going to a notepad as a first instinct is hard for me to grasp.
<!--more--></p>

<p>I’m slowly growing fond of pen and paper. I’ve written meeting notes on paper for a long time but it’s only been the last few months that I’ve really embraced the value of writing daily schedules and brainstorming sessions on a notepad. And for someone so devoted to digital tools I must confess that the results have baffled me.</p>

<p>Mike Schmitz and I <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/33/">talked about this</a> on the podcast recently. Because physically writing something down engages more of your body and requires you to use more of your self to get the idea out of your mind, you have more memory indicators created in your brain. In turn, it leaves you with more connections made and more ability to recall the thing you wrote down. In other words, writing it on paper helps you remember more than typing it into a computer.</p>

<p>When I started writing out a daily plan on paper I found that I didn’t need to reference the paper nearly as often as I used to reference my digital calendar. I was able to move from one task to the next with little or no transition cost. I knew what the next step of my day was without needing to look at the paper.</p>

<p>After doing this for the better side of a month I went back to using my digital calendar with no loss of results over the paper version. The experience of writing it down with pen and paper solidified the rationale and nuances of the process. It showed me the importance of deciding where the minutes of my day will go and the repetitiveness of my real schedule began to come through. It was only after I developed the memory through handwriting the daily schedule that I was able to best utilize the digital calendar and understand the cycles I naturally fall into.</p>

<p>And that proved to have great value. Developing an awareness of how you work is the best way to create truly productive systems. But it turns out that once I went back to the digital calendar, the side effects of relying on calendar alerts and the use of repeating events aren’t worth the move back to digital. I can now understand how to set up my digital calendar in more detail. But doing so and using it leaves me with symptoms I’d rather not have. So I’m back on the paper for my daily schedule.</p>

<p>The time it takes to write it out by hand and think it through in detail every day develops a memory that I can use throughout the day and relieves me of the robotic nature of recurring events that aren’t regularly kept in check.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/The-OmniFocus-Dashboard.png" /><p>I write and talk about my OmniFocus Dashboard a lot. And that’s for good reason: it’s the central hub of my day-to-day work and the place where my decisions about the day surface.
<!--more--></p>

<p>The intent behind the Dashboard is to show me a list of tasks to be completed today. I want those tasks to be shown in order, meaning I start at the top and work to the bottom. There’s no need to choose the next task because I’ve already decided ahead of time.</p>

<p>Before I get too far into this, let’s go through the setup. All the Dashboard contains are tasks that are <em>Due or Flagged</em>. The task needs to have a due date within the next five days or I must manually flag it before it shows up here. As for the display settings, I want it to group tasks by context but sort by project.</p>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-mini" src="/assets/posts_extra/the-omnifocus-dashboard/settings.png" /></p>

<p><img class="right-image post-image-tiny" style="max-width: 100px;" src="/assets/posts_extra/the-omnifocus-dashboard/contexts.png" /></p>

<p>I keep my contexts in order of importance from top to bottom. And I give my @Admin tasks the highest priority. If the task impacts the state of my system and accuracy of the projects in it, I want that task to be completed first. I want to trust that I have all the appropriate information collected and in place before I move on. With the perspective grouped by context, it first sorts the tasks by context; and with the @Admin context at the top of my list, it shows up first on the Dashboard.</p>

<p><img class="left-image post-image-tiny" style="max-width: 125px;" src="/assets/posts_extra/the-omnifocus-dashboard/projects.png" /></p>

<p>I also sort my projects in order of importance. See a theme here? At the top of my project list is a folder called <em>Guidance</em>. It holds my higher horizons, reviews, and meta projects. Again, I want these at the top of the list because these projects keep my daily activities in alignment with my long-term goals. With the Dashboard sorted by project, the tasks within the context groupings maintain the priority I give my projects. I should also note that all projects in this Guidance folder are flagged and their tasks are given the @Admin context. The flag is what pulls them into the Dashboard and the context ensures they will always be at the top.</p>

<h2 id="reviews">Reviews</h2>

<p>The projects at the very top are my reviews: daily, weekly, monthly, and annual in that order. I need to complete my daily review before I go on to the weekly review. The same goes for the monthly and annual reviews. I can’t make decisions about which projects to take on or drop if there are still unprocessed tasks in my inbox. The system must be up-to-date beforehand. Again, these projects are flagged and all their tasks are given the @Admin context, so these tasks show up in the first grouping of the Dashboard.</p>

<h2 id="meta">Meta</h2>

<p>Underneath my reviews are a couple meta projects I’ve put in place to help me accomplish my weekly commitments and the projects that are important to me. The first is called <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/the-important-not-urgent-projects/"><em>Important Projects</em></a> and it’s set to repeat daily.  It’s a simple list that helps me put valued projects first and it’s the first thing I do once my reviews are completed. These aren’t tasks themselves but they prompt me to go elsewhere in OmniFocus to complete a task that pertains to the original item.</p>

<p>The second meta project is called <em>Weekly Creation</em> and it repeats weekly. I do my best to write two articles for this site and record one podcast episode each week. This project holds a few tasks that come after the <em>Important Projects</em> tasks. I need to have this week’s content created before I move on to other work for the week. Again, these two projects are flagged to add them to the Dashboard.</p>

<h2 id="due-or-flagged">Due or Flagged</h2>

<p>Once all reviews and important tasks are completed, I move on to the tasks that will be due soon or that I’ve decided to work that today. The due soon tasks show up automatically based on how close I am to the due date. For me, that means five days out from the assigned date. I want a little lead time on these. But I fill the remainder of my day’s work with tasks that I’ve flagged. Sometimes these apply to the projects on my <em>Important Projects</em> list, but often times they are simple one-off tasks that are bugging me and I want done.</p>

<h2 id="reality">Reality</h2>

<p>The nice thing about this Dashboard is that it is mostly robotic. It happens on its own. Each day these tasks show up without me needing to do anything. But there’s risk involved with that. You can become numb to seeing them every day; if you skip one day, it becomes easy to skip them the next; or you start looking through the list, get overwhelmed by it, and do nothing. For me, the problem can arise when I start re-thinking my previous decisions that led to the list in the first place. I’m not always the best at sticking to it, but I know if I trust my previous self that I have a greater tendency to create flow and accomplish more by the end of the day.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/the-flawed-foundation-of-diets.jpg" /><p>After working on multiple sides of agriculture and seeing how the back-end of the food industry operates, I’ve come to the realization that there is some really bad information out there about agriculture and how we decide what to eat.
<!--more--></p>

<p>Most of our decisions about what to eat are adopted from a huge list of diets. There are a lot of cultural diets, but anymore most Western diets are put together with a purpose in mind. Some of them help us put on muscle and some help lower cholesterol levels. There’s even a <a href="http://www.tofugu.com/japan/japan-long-breath-diet/">breathing diet</a> to help you lose weight. No matter the goal, diets face an underlying flaw in their design.</p>

<p>When you break it down, a diet is simply a recommendation on how to achieve health through the food that you consume. It’s a way of eating that provides you with a long, energetic life. But the problem we face today is the plethora of diets out there all claiming to be the best way to eat. A lot of these diets contradict each other and leave us wondering which ones are worthwhile. What’s worse is the regular discovery of new scientific evidence revealing the fact that some diets actually make us <em>less</em> healthy than we were originally.</p>

<p>Why is that? Let’s go back to the premise of what a diet is: a recommendation on how to eat. In order to make an honest and accurate recommendation we need information and experience with the thing we are recommending. Generally speaking, you wouldn’t ask a web developer to work on your car. Most developers don’t have the deep knowledge about cars that they would need to find the issue with your motor. The food industry is much the same.</p>

<p>The vast majority of diets are based on research done by scientists. We run across diets created by individuals once in a while but those typically have a base derived from the research done by scientists. We learn that antioxidants can help fight or prevent cancer, so we put together a recommendation on how to get more of them into our daily food intake. We even go to the extreme of adding them into products where they don’t naturally exist so that we can consume even more of them. But that mindset can give us <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/antioxidants-may-make-cancer-worse/">alarming results</a>.</p>

<p>Any time we develop new research that shows a way to prevent or fight a disease or that shows the health benefits of a specific nutrient, we blow it out of proportion. You would think that with all the research being done and the experience we have with eating that we would know how to eat healthfully. Why can’t we get this right?</p>

<p>In order to make a perfect recommendation, you have to know <em>everything</em> about the thing you’re recommending. If you don’t know everything about it, there will inevitably be flaws in the rationale behind the recommendation. Sometimes those flaws are no big deal but sometimes they have unexpected results.</p>

<p>Say I recommend a wireless router to a friend. It’s one I’ve used for years and have a great experience with. My friend trusts me so he buys the router. He sets it up and has nothing but issues with it. I come over and give it a try with no luck. After digging into it, I find out that this router doesn’t play nice with his specific modem. I made what I thought was a great recommendation but it turned out to be a nightmare for my friend. If had known about the pairing issues of that combination, I wouldn’t have recommended it. I didn’t know <em>everything</em> about the router even though I thought it was excellent.</p>

<p>We have a lot of data about the human body. We understand things about it that our great-grandparents could only speculate about. And that means we have a ton of information at our disposal that we can use to build the perfect recommendation on how to eat. But remember what I said earlier:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In order to make a perfect recommendation, you have to know <em>everything</em> about the thing you’re recommending.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In order to make the perfect diet, we have to know <em>everything</em> about the human body. We have to know about every nutrient that exists, how they work in combinations, and what our digestive system does with each one. We also have to understand how we break those nutrients down and how they help brain function. We need to know how our nutritional needs change as we age and develop. But it turns out there’s a lot we don’t know about ourselves:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/what-we-know-about-the-brain-2015-5">What we know about the brain</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.newscientist.com/round-up/ten-mysteries-of-you">Ten things we don’t understand about humans</a></p>

<p><a href="http://mentalfloss.com/article/65435/scientists-discover-new-part-human-body">Scientists Discover a New Part of the Human Body</a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.sciencenews.org/article/body%E2%80%99s-bacteria-don%E2%80%99t-outnumber-human-cells-so-much-after-all">Body’s bacteria don’t outnumber human cells so much after all</a></p>

<p>The other side of this is that we don’t even understand the food itself well enough to know how it fits into our own nutrition. Take the tomato for example. It’s consumed all over the world and yet we know very little about <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/31/science/the-tomato-ripe-juicy-and-bursting-with-genes.html">why it has more genes</a> than we do. If we can’t explain everything about our own bodies and the food that we eat, how can we expect anyone to develop a diet that completely meets our nutritional needs?</p>

<p>It simply isn’t possible to develop a diet that is completely accurate and 100% reliable. We don’t know enough to do that. Yes, we can put together good guesses and see great results, but we often don’t see the long-term effects for many years and by that time we may have learned that it was actually a really bad idea all along.</p>

<p>Scientists are doing an excellent job of learning about us and the food we eat. We’ve been able to create diets for people struggling with diseases and help patients extend their lives and have a higher quality of life at the same time. There’s a lot of value in these continued attempts to make the best recommendations we can. And the more we learn about ourselves, the better these recommendations get. But we will very likely never have the ability to build the perfect diet and we will never be able to manufacture the perfect food.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, we simply need to keep in mind that the diets we choose to follow are never ideal. Scientists are great at giving us information to follow, but we need to remember the basics when we decide what to eat.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/Evernote-vs-Raw-Files.jpg" /><p>Ever since I published an <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/an-alternative-to-evernote/">article about leaving Evernote</a> I’ve received numerous recommendations for alternatives. It seems there is an endless supply of catchall buckets that you can drop information into.  I appreciate all the ideas, but it isn’t the point.
<!--more--></p>

<p>The majority of my complaints with Evernote revolve around portability and a proprietary format. It’s not an easy task to work with the notes in other applications and it’s not trivial to take the text out of the note, work on it, and bring it back in on iOS. But there are a lot of the details that have me avoiding Evernote and its alternatives.</p>

<h2 id="formatting-text">Formatting Text</h2>

<p>I just don’t do it. 95% of all my writing is in markdown. I’m even starting to do this when I take handwritten notes. The only time I don’t use markdown is when I’m creating a Pages document for a client, which is rare anymore. So I never have a need to create rich text in any way. That mostly stems from my <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/choosing-the-right-medium/">medium of sharing words</a>: the web. Everything eventually ends up in HTML and the words I type that <em>don’t</em> end up on the web are short-form or for personal reference. In either case, I don’t have the need or the time to make something bold or change a font size. To me, it has just as much impact in its natural state as it does formatted.</p>

<h2 id="checklists">Checklists</h2>

<p>I used to keep all my checklists in Evernote. I even found a way to do <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/recurring-checklists-in-evernote/">recurring checklists in Evernote</a>. But that was before I moved <em>every</em> task item into OmniFocus. My Evernote lists worked great at the time, but I prefer the consolidation of every action item in one place and all reference material in a separate place.</p>

<h2 id="pictures-and-files">Pictures and Files</h2>

<p>One major benefit to using Evernote is the ability to keep pictures and files right alongside of the text that you’re storing. It’s an awesome feature, but it comes with a lot of downsides. What if I need to edit the picture or file? It’s rare that I don’t make changes to them in some way. It might be annotations or adding lines to a spreadsheet but if I want to do anything with them I need to make sure I’m on my Mac. It works pretty well there, but the moment you try this on iOS it gets really messy, really fast. The extra work and time involved in pulling it off is not for me. Keeping everything in a single folder in DropBox is much more compatible with the tools I prefer to use.</p>

<h2 id="storage-style">Storage Style</h2>

<p>I’m grateful for all the suggestions on alternatives to Evernote. I now know there are a lot of great ones out there. But I think I’ve developed a new (old?) information storage preference. I enjoy the flexibility of working with standard file types themselves. They’re easy to use and predict, and my use of them is not dependent on the features of a single company or application. If I want to make edits to my information, I don’t have to use a specific app to do it. And I can move from one system to another with little to no overhead and migration steps. I’m free from a single ecosystem; that’s what I like about it.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/The-important-not-urgent-projects.jpg" /><p>We all have those projects that we <em>know</em> we should be working on, but without a deadline or someone relying on you it’s hard to keep it going. Things come up and the easy tasks to put off are the ones without urgency pushing them on.
<!--more--></p>

<p>I have a tendency to pick up a shiny new project and set aside the projects that move me toward my longer term goals. It’s easy to do because those long distance projects have no (noticeable) ramifications when they’re delayed. I can always make up the difference later or move the potential launch date back a bit without anyone noticing.</p>

<p>But that undermines my own mission. If I want to help others get better at their systems and develop a more meaningful life, I need to stay the course and keep working on the projects without a deadline and that have a bigger long-term impact.</p>

<p>I recently spent some time reflecting on these projects, trying to find time for them  each week. I wanted to put my hands to work instead of just thinking or talking, because “It’s the thought that counts” isn’t much of a business model. I thought about dedicating one or two days a week to them, but that would lead to slower progress in the end. What I really need to do is check something off for these projects every single day. They need to move forward every day no matter how small the progress is. Those incremental gains can make a big impact over time.</p>

<p>If I’m going to step up and work on these every day, it makes sense to create a checklist of the projects and tasks I need to complete each day. It also feeds my love of lists.</p>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-medium" src="/assets/posts_extra/the_important_not_urgent_projects/important-project-list.jpg" /></p>

<p>This shows up on my OmniFocus Dashboard every day and I go through it top to bottom along with everything else I do in the day. This means I set aside more of the “procrastiworking” tasks I tend to work on instead of my key projects, which is a good thing. There are some short-term sacrifices I make to do this but I don’t think anyone would say it’s not worth it.</p>

<p>To get a little more technical on the <em>how</em>, here are the settings I use for the project itself in OmniFocus:</p>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-tiny" src="/assets/posts_extra/the_important_not_urgent_projects/important-project-settings.jpg" /></p>

<p>The idea is to flag the project to add it to my Dashboard (Due and Flagged), have it repeat every day, and mark the project complete after all tasks are completed.</p>

<p>Now I have a daily reminder and checklist that ensures I make progress on these important projects. I don’t care how small it is, but I <em>will</em> move them forward. It’s that small contribution each day that really adds up.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/And-Now.jpg" /><p>I ran across this idea when reading an article by <a href="https://sivers.org/">Derek Sivers</a>. The premise is simple: creating a frequently updated page to show what the person is currently doing. The concept really resonated with me, and I expanded on it a bit.
<!--more--></p>

<p>Sivers calls it a <em>Now</em> page and even created <a href="http://nownownow.com/">an index of these pages</a>. I started looking through these pages and loved a lot of the ideas I found. It was a classic case of being unable to make up my mind. So instead of picking one area or one page to keep updated, I built a site that showcases where my time goes, what I’m reading, what I’m currently developing, and a growing portfolio of my work.</p>

<p>In the future, I’d like to add an Apps page that keeps a list of the tools I’m using on my devices, but that’s an extensive addition, so it needs to come at a later time.</p>

<p>So if you’re curious about what I’m up to, go check out <a href="http://now.joebuhlig.com">now.joebuhlig.com</a>.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/Timing-Tasks.jpg" /><p>In a previous role I spent some time researching project management software and evaluating it for company use. One of the turn-offs that my end users brought up was an extreme distaste for running a stopwatch on the tasks being tracked. I get it. No one wants to be stuck to a clock, especially when those reviewing the numbers are your managers.
<!--more--></p>

<p>I didn’t want to go that route either. I’ve always had a resistance to due dates, but some of it was fear that the data would be used against me. It would be hard not to compare my times to that of my coworkers. It wouldn’t matter if I came out better or not, quality of work would no longer be the main consideration if speed took over as the primary indicator.</p>

<p>When I started working for myself, I finally came around to the idea of starting a stopwatch at the beginning of every new task. The data was staying in my own hands. It could help me maximize my time without the potential for negative consequences. So I set up <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/tracking-time-with-launch-center-pro/">a process with Launch Center Pro</a> to help track my time.</p>

<p>My intent was to understand where I spent the most time and look for places to cut back. I was seeking maximum impact for the least amount of time spent since every action I take can directly influence my income. But after timing my work for a while, I found there were more benefits to starting that stopwatch than I expected.</p>

<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>The first of these was my original (and only) intent: a record of how much time I spend on tasks. Keeping track of how much time I spend on tasks helps me see if I’m allocating too much of my day to one activity. I can’t say that I had any big <em>aha</em> moments as I’ve looked through the data, but it’s at least interesting to see how much time goes into writing an article or designing and building a website.</p>

<h2 id="estimations">Estimations</h2>

<p>Once I know how long something usually takes, I can estimate how much time to allocate to a task prior to starting. The past is the most accurate indicator of the future. This is why it’s so dangerous (and manipulative) to make even slight changes to history books and data records. If you want to honestly understand where you currently stand and how something will pan out in the future, you can study the past and see how things work out. History is an indicator for our actions in the present. The same is true for the time it takes to complete a task. The more we know about our completed tasks, the better we are at predicting the outcomes of our current and future tasks.</p>

<h2 id="self-competition">Self-Competition</h2>

<p>If we know how much time something usually takes us and we are about to begin a similar task, we have a benchmark to compare against. We have a time to beat. I think this holds the most value if you are the sole owner of the data and want to get better at the task. You can choose to let the time go longer if you’re working to improve the quality or you can work on speed if you’re trying to gain efficiency. In both cases, though, you know and understand your goal.</p>

<h2 id="focus">Focus</h2>

<p>I was caught off-guard by this one. When I start that timer, I know that I’ll be recording the number when I’m done. The time will go into storage and into the broader history of the data I’ve  stored. The last thing I want to do is have that number include tasks outside of what I recorded. It will muddy the waters with false data, and I cannot <em>stand</em> false data. If I spend 10 minutes checking Twitter in the middle of designing a logo and I record it as time spent designing, the record is incorrect. So I take advantage of my loathing for bad data sets and use it to stay focused on the task.</p>

<h2 id="everything">Everything?</h2>

<p>Absolutely not. Don’t be crazy. You should not have a stopwatch running when you’re having coffee with your spouse. Only time the tasks that need a record or that tend to get away from you. Leisure and play should be allowed to roam. Tasks for work or your side projects are likely the primary commitments worth timing. Those are typically the only areas where we strive for efficiency and focus. It doesn’t work to be laser-focused while at the beach on vacation.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/A-Text-File-Weather-Forececast.jpg" /><p>It never fails. I sit at our kitchen table over breakfast and mention to my wife that it’s going to snow that day. The first question she asks? <em>“How much?”</em> I don’t know! All I know is that my alert says it’s supposed to happen!
<!--more--></p>

<p>After going through this exchange so many times that my wife realized she was driving me crazy <em>then continued to ask because she enjoys taunting me</em>, I gave up and created my own weather forecast. I wanted to know temperatures and precipitation amounts and keep a daily record of each forecast. I figured if I was going to go through the trouble of creating it, I might as well make it possible to search a date and get the forecast from that day. I turned to text files and Google Scripts.</p>

<h2 id="today">Today</h2>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-small" style="width:40%;" src="/assets/posts_extra/a_text_file_weather_forecast/weather-today.jpg" /></p>

<p>To set this up, you’ll need access to Google Drive and a <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/weather/api?apiref=6977fd0285651b13">developer account with Weather Underground</a>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a new Google Apps Script in Google Drive.</li>
  <li>Paste the code below into the script.</li>
  <li>Replace the _X_s in the script with your Weather Underground API key and change the city/state to your location.</li>
  <li>Set up a trigger to run the function automatically (Resources &gt; Current project’s triggers).</li>
</ol>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-medium" src="/assets/posts_extra/a_text_file_weather_forecast/app-trigger.jpg" /></p>

<p>Here’s the script you’ll need:</p>

<noscript><pre>function weatherLogger() {
  var url = &quot;http://api.wunderground.com/api/XXXXXXXXXXX/forecast/q/STATE/CITY.json&quot;
  var response = UrlFetchApp.fetch(url);
  var weather = JSON.parse(response);
  var summary = weather.forecast.simpleforecast.forecastday[0];
  var newFileData = summary[&quot;date&quot;][&quot;pretty&quot;] + &quot;\n&quot;;
  newFileData += &quot;\n&quot;;
  newFileData += &quot;High temp: &quot; + summary[&quot;high&quot;][&quot;fahrenheit&quot;] + &quot;°F/&quot; + summary[&quot;high&quot;][&quot;celsius&quot;] + &quot;°C&quot;;
  newFileData += &quot;\n&quot;;
  newFileData += &quot;Low temp: &quot; + summary[&quot;low&quot;][&quot;fahrenheit&quot;] + &quot;°F/&quot; + summary[&quot;low&quot;][&quot;celsius&quot;] + &quot;°C&quot;;
  newFileData += &quot;\n&quot;;
  newFileData += &quot;Conditions: &quot; + summary[&quot;conditions&quot;];
  newFileData += &quot;\n&quot;;
  newFileData += &quot;Precipitation: &quot; + summary[&quot;qpf_allday&quot;][&quot;in&quot;];
  newFileData += &quot;\n&quot;;
  newFileData += &quot;Snow: &quot; + summary[&quot;snow_allday&quot;][&quot;in&quot;];
  newFileData += &quot;\n&quot;;
  newFileData += &quot;Max Wind Speed: &quot; + summary[&quot;maxwind&quot;][&quot;mph&quot;] + &quot;mph &quot; + summary[&quot;maxwind&quot;][&quot;dir&quot;];
  newFileData += &quot;\n&quot;;
  newFileData += &quot;Avg Wind Speed: &quot; + summary[&quot;avewind&quot;][&quot;mph&quot;] + &quot;mph &quot; + summary[&quot;avewind&quot;][&quot;dir&quot;];
  newFileData += &quot;\n&quot;;
  newFileData += &quot;Humidity: &quot; + summary[&quot;avehumidity&quot;];
  newFileData += &quot;\n&quot;;
  newFileData += &quot;\n&quot;;
  newFileData += &quot;Raw Data:&quot;;
  
  for (var key in summary) {
    var dataToLog = key + &quot;: &quot; + JSON.stringify(summary[key]);
    if (newFileData == &quot;&quot;) {
      newFileData = dataToLog;
    }
    else {
      newFileData += &quot;\n&quot;;
      newFileData += dataToLog;
    };
  };
  var today = new Date();
  var d = new Date(today);
  var y = d.getFullYear();
  var m = d.getMonth();
  m = m + 1
  m = &quot;00&quot; + m
  m = m.substr(m.length - 2);
  var day = d.getDate();
  day = &quot;00&quot; + day;
  day = day.substr(day.length - 2);
  var dateString = y + m + day;
  DriveApp.createFile(&quot;Weatherx_Todayx_&quot; + dateString + &quot;.txt&quot;, newFileData);
}</pre></noscript>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/joebuhlig/488a95d9072b6c8a1500.js"> </script>

<p>When run, the script will create a text file at the top-level of your Google Drive. From there you can use Hazel to move and rename these files however you like. For example, I use Hazel to rename the files to just the date and move them to DropBox within <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/text-file-setup-and-workflow/">my text file setup</a>.</p>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-medium" src="/assets/posts_extra/a_text_file_weather_forecast/hazel-rule.jpg" /></p>

<h2 id="yesterday">Yesterday</h2>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-small" style="width:40%;" src="/assets/posts_extra/a_text_file_weather_forecast/weather-yesterday.jpg" /></p>

<p>Once I had today’s forecast working properly, I took the next step: keeping a history of what actually happened the day before. This was primarily so I could determine how much rain we had yesterday. I grew up on a crop farm. The most common question in a farming community is, “How much rain did you get last night?” That almost instinctual curiosity has never left me, but instead of setting up a rain gauge like most good farmers, I just altered my forecast script to give the data from the day before in the same format.</p>

<p>Everything for this historical record works the same as the forecast. The only difference is the location of the API call and the parsing of the data.</p>

<noscript><pre>function weatherLogger() {
  var url = &quot;http://api.wunderground.com/api/XXXXXXXXXXX/yesterday/q/STATE/CITY.json&quot;
  var response = UrlFetchApp.fetch(url);
  var data = JSON.parse(response);
  var summary = data.history.dailysummary[0];
  var slength = summary.length;
  var newFileData = summary[&quot;date&quot;][&quot;pretty&quot;] + &quot;\n&quot;;
  newFileData += &quot;\n&quot;;
  newFileData += &quot;High temp: &quot; + summary[&quot;maxtempi&quot;];
  newFileData += &quot;\n&quot;;
  newFileData += &quot;Low temp: &quot; + summary[&quot;mintempi&quot;];
  newFileData += &quot;\n&quot;;
  newFileData += &quot;Avg temp: &quot; + summary[&quot;meantempi&quot;];
  newFileData += &quot;\n&quot;;
  newFileData += &quot;Rain: &quot; + summary[&quot;rain&quot;];
  newFileData += &quot;\n&quot;;
  newFileData += &quot;Snow: &quot; + summary[&quot;snow&quot;] + &quot; &quot; + summary[&quot;snowfalli&quot;] + &quot; &quot; + summary[&quot;snowdepthi&quot;];
  newFileData += &quot;\n&quot;;
  newFileData += &quot;Precipitation: &quot; + summary[&quot;precipi&quot;];
  newFileData += &quot;\n&quot;;
  newFileData += &quot;Growing Degree Days: &quot; + summary[&quot;gdegreedays&quot;];
  newFileData += &quot;\n&quot;;
  newFileData += &quot;Max Wind Speed: &quot; + summary[&quot;maxwspdi&quot;] + &quot;mph&quot;;
  newFileData += &quot;\n&quot;;
  newFileData += &quot;Avg Wind Speed: &quot; + summary[&quot;meanwindspdi&quot;] + &quot;mph &quot; + summary[&quot;meanwdire&quot;];
  newFileData += &quot;\n&quot;;
  newFileData += &quot;Humidity: &quot; + summary[&quot;humidity&quot;];
  newFileData += &quot;\n&quot;;
  newFileData += &quot;\n&quot;;
  newFileData += &quot;Raw Data:&quot;;
  
  for (var key in summary) {
    var dataToLog = key + &quot;: &quot; + JSON.stringify(summary[key]);
    if (newFileData == &quot;&quot;) {
      newFileData = dataToLog;
    }
    else {
      newFileData += &quot;\n&quot;;
      newFileData += dataToLog;
    };
  };
  var today = new Date();
  var d = new Date(today);
  d.setDate(today.getDate() - 1);
  var y = d.getFullYear();
  var m = d.getMonth();
  m = m + 1
  m = &quot;00&quot; + m
  m = m.substr(m.length - 2);
  var day = d.getDate();
  day - 1;
  day = &quot;00&quot; + day;
  day = day.substr(day.length - 2);
  var dateString = y + m + day;
  DriveApp.createFile(&quot;Weatherx_Yesterdayx_&quot; + dateString + &quot;.txt&quot;, newFileData);
}

</pre></noscript>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/joebuhlig/d652e20182ed3c380e15.js"> </script>

<p>The benefit of having both of these in place is the ability to compare the forecast to what actually happened. The only issue with doing this is the result: it shows just how bad forecasts really are at predicting weather. But hey, at least breakfast with my wife is less maddening.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/Choosing-OmniFocus-Settings.jpg" /><p>No application setup is complete without tweaking the settings to your liking. This is the power (and struggle) of OmniFocus. Some of the available options make drastic changes while others lead to subtleties you may not notice.
<!--more--></p>

<p>I use the Mac version of OmniFocus as the “home base” of my setup. I make most of my changes there and let them sync to iOS. There are a few settings specific to mobile, but the majority of the following options will be dedicated to OmniFocus 2 for Mac.</p>

<h2 id="general">General</h2>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-small" src="/assets/posts_extra/choosing_omnifocus_settings/General_Preferences.jpg" /></p>

<p>One of the most powerful advantages of high resolution screens is the ability to condense information and see the full context of the current task. The more you can see at once the easier it is to understand what’s going on. That’s one thing I love about being able to adjust the text size in OmniFocus. Try to make it as small as possible while still being able to read it. If you can see every task assigned to a project when you’re reviewing it, you can make a clearer decision about it.</p>

<p>It can be painful when vital keyboard shortcuts change on you. Muscle memory is not overcome without a number of frustrating mistakes. There were a number of simple keystrokes in OmniFocus 1 ingrained in my fingers that were changed in OmniFocus 2. You can revert to the old way by using the <em>Classic Mode</em> for outlining, but when applications make changes on this scale, it’s typically for a good reason and I try to bite the bullet and change with them. It’s always possible that the old way will be dropped entirely in the future. To save myself trouble later on, I use the <em>Modern Mode</em> for outlining. And to be honest, after switching it does make a lot of sense.</p>

<p>The <em>Quick Entry Shortcut</em> and the <em>Clippings Shortcut</em> are both settings you should tweak to your liking. I use a combination of the Spacebar and other modifier keys to invoke most blank capture and search mechanisms. So in my case I use Control + Option + Space to pull up the <em>Quick Entry Dialog</em>. If I’m capturing selected text or existing data, I use Command + Shift and a letter to indicate the program I want the data to land in. In this case, I use Command + Shift + O for the <em>Clippings Shortcut</em>.</p>

<h2 id="organization">Organization</h2>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-small" src="/assets/posts_extra/choosing_omnifocus_settings/Organization_Preferences.jpg" /></p>

<p>I highly recommend cleaning up items only when they have both a Project and a Context. This means new tasks only leave your inbox when they have both of these assigned; any other scenario leaves the task at risk of not being clearly defined. Even if there needs to be a placeholder context or project, it’s still better than making a partial decision about the task. Let this setting push you to be as clear as you can.</p>

<p>You have an option for doing this cleanup process automatically (as soon as the criteria is met) or when you change views or perspectives. I’ve found that it really depends on how you like to work with tasks. If you like to see completed tasks sitting there with a checkmark, set this to <em>When changing views</em>. But if you’re like me and you want your list to shrink as you check things off, set it to <em>Immediately</em>.</p>

<p>Do you have a tendency to create new projects already thought out with a series of tasks that must be completed in a set order? Or do you tend to add tasks as you think of them and most of your projects don’t follow a set pattern? In the case of the former, you will likely want all your new projects to start off as sequential. I fall into the latter category and prefer them to start as parallel. That allows me to keep adding tasks to the project and have them show up on my context lists immediately.</p>

<p>The last option here is for showing the projects and groups in your context lists. This is mostly preference. If you have a task group assigned to @Computer, that group will show up in your Computer context list. Personally, I feel that this adds clutter to my list, so I leave this unchecked.</p>

<h2 id="layout">Layout</h2>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-small" src="/assets/posts_extra/choosing_omnifocus_settings/Layout_Preferences.jpg" /></p>

<p>Remember what I said about data density? I think there’s a lot of value in condensed formats. Seeing as much information as I can at one time helps me understand the situation better. So I prefer to use the <em>Custom Columns</em>  or <em>Fluid</em> layouts. You can see the exact columns I’m using in the screenshot. Those specific columns help me make the best decision on the next task to work on.</p>

<h2 id="dates--times">Dates &amp; Times</h2>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-small" src="/assets/posts_extra/choosing_omnifocus_settings/Date_Time_Preferences.jpg" /></p>

<p>When do you want tasks to be marked as “Due Soon?” When you mark a task with a due date, when does that task show a yellow indicator? This really depends on how quickly your tasks come and go and how long it takes to complete them. In my case those combined criteria lead me to a five day lead time. I want an indicator when something is due in five days or less.</p>

<p>The next three settings are about default times. You’ll want to set these in a way that makes sense based on your daily schedule. When I defer a task I want it to show up the morning of the date I set, so I use midnight as the default defer time. I typically go to bed around 9pm, so I make sure tasks are completed by then if they are due. Finally, I want to make sure every project is reviewed weekly. In rare cases, I’ll adjust a project to go further out but the vast majority of my projects need a weekly look.</p>

<h2 id="notifications">Notifications</h2>

<p>In 99% of cases, I turn off notifications from apps on my devices. There are very few alerts important enough to warrant a change in direction, but OmniFocus is an exception. If OmniFocus notifies me, I need to know about it. It is an indicator that I missed something and it needs to be dealt with immediately. I can’t afford to let those slide.</p>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-small" src="/assets/posts_extra/choosing_omnifocus_settings/Notification_Preferences.jpg" /></p>

<p>To help with getting my attention, OmniFocus has the ability to use “soft” alerts. These are the dock icon badge and perspective highlights. I use both to indicate when I have tasks that are due soon or flagged. I rely on my phone for these because I prefer a single place for alerts and since my phone is always with me, it makes sense as the central hub.</p>

<p>When I do get alerts, I want them to be important. I avoid due dates on my tasks as much as I can so when I see a badge icon or get a notification, it has some weight behind it. To maintain that importance, I limit alerts to tasks that are due in some way.</p>

<p>I don’t use it on my Mac nearly as much as my phone, but I really like having my Dashboard (flagged and due tasks) in my Today view. It’s nice to see this list with a single swipe.</p>

<p>I’ve never been a big fan of putting my tasks on the calendar. That may work for you, but I’ve never found a way to do that without creating my nemesis: clutter.</p>

<h2 id="synchronization">Synchronization</h2>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-small" src="/assets/posts_extra/choosing_omnifocus_settings/Synchronization_Preferences.jpg" /></p>

<p>You can get fancy with how you sync your data but I prefer to trust the Omni Group. They know their data better than I do, so I stick with their service to move the data around.</p>

<h2 id="update">Update</h2>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-small" src="/assets/posts_extra/choosing_omnifocus_settings/Update_Preferences.jpg" /></p>

<p>It’s good to get new features and bug fixes, so I enable checking for daily updates. I know that some folks prefer not to send information back to companies, and in some cases I might do the same. But the Omni Group has gained my trust and I want to help them continue to build a quality product. So in this case, I opt to send them anonymous data.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/A-Record-of-Completed-Tasks.jpg" /><p>There are times when I want to look back and see what I did on a specific day. This is extremely helpful when I need a record for a client, but no matter the reason, I find myself referring to my task history frequently.
<!--more--></p>

<p>There are two ways I access these completed tasks: in an OmniFocus perspective and in daily text files.</p>

<h2 id="daily-review">Daily Review</h2>

<p>The OmniFocus  perspective that I use to view my completed tasks is one of the stock perspectives, and doesn’t require a Pro account. Here are the specific settings I’m using:</p>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-small" src="/assets/posts_extra/a_record_of_completed_tasks/completed-perspective.jpg" /></p>

<p>Some days it can be a challenge to pick up where I left off the day before. I can look at the upcoming tasks on my Dashboard but that doesn’t give me the context of what I  just finished doing for those projects. So at the end of my <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/gaining-perspective-daily-review/">Daily Review</a> I look over this Completed perspective. It’s a quick view of what I’ve been working on and helps me pick up where I left off.</p>

<h2 id="text-files">Text Files</h2>

<p>For longer term storage of completed tasks, I create text files detailing the progress of  tasks and projects that day. Under each project is a list of the completed tasks and their completion date.</p>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-small" src="/assets/posts_extra/a_record_of_completed_tasks/task-report.jpg" /></p>

<p>The idea here is to create a historical record of what I did each day. It allows me to go back in time to any day I want and see exactly which projects I was working on and the progress I made.</p>

<h2 id="applescript-and-hazel">AppleScript and Hazel</h2>

<p>These text files are created automatically, because there’s no way I’m going to copy/paste the data into place every day. I wrote an AppleScript that creates them and the script is run by Hazel, so my Mac needs to be turned on to run it; I can’t see the text file for yesterday until my Mac has had a chance to run the script today. I should note that this script is designed to be an external script, not embedded. Here’s what the Hazel rule looks like:</p>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-small" src="/assets/posts_extra/a_record_of_completed_tasks/hazel-rule.jpg" /></p>

<p>And here’s the external AppleScript used in the rule:</p>

<noscript><pre>on hazelProcessFile(theFile)
	set filePath to &quot;/Users/JoeBuhlig/Dropbox/Text/TaskReports/&quot; -- Where to save the resulting text file (Be sure to add the trailing &quot;/&quot;)
	
	-- Create the new filename as YYYYMMDD.txt
	set todayDate to current date
	set yestDate to todayDate - 1 * days
	set {year:y, month:m, day:d} to yestDate
	set fileName to y * 10000
	set fileName to fileName + (m * 100)
	set fileName to fileName + d
	
	-- Set the starting date of the report
	set startDate to todayDate - 1 * days
	set startDate&#39;s hours to 0
	set startDate&#39;s minutes to 0
	set startDate&#39;s seconds to 0
	
	-- Set the ending date of the report
	set endDate to todayDate - 1 * days
	set endDate&#39;s hours to 23
	set endDate&#39;s minutes to 59
	set endDate&#39;s seconds to 59
	
	-- Create the blank report to build from
	set reportText to &quot;&quot;
	
	tell application &quot;OmniFocus&quot;
		tell front document
			set theProjects to every flattened project where its modification date is greater than startDate and modification date is less than endDate
			repeat with a from 1 to length of theProjects
				set currentProj to item a of theProjects
				set theTasks to (every flattened task of currentProj where its completed = true and completion date is greater than startDate and completion date is less than endDate)
				if theTasks is not equal to {} then
					set reportText to reportText &amp; return &amp; return &amp; &quot;------------------------------&quot; &amp; return &amp; name of currentProj &amp; return
					repeat with b from 1 to length of theTasks
						set currentTask to item b of theTasks
						set completedDate to completion date of currentTask
						set completedTime to time string of completedDate
						set reportText to reportText &amp; return &amp; name of currentTask &amp; &quot; ----- &quot; &amp; completedTime
					end repeat
				end if
			end repeat
			if reportText is equal to &quot;&quot; then
				reportText = &quot;Nothing completed for this day.&quot;
			end if
			set runTime to date string of (todayDate - 1 * days)
			set reportText to runTime &amp; return &amp; return &amp; reportText
			set newFile to open for access filePath &amp; fileName &amp; &quot;.txt&quot; with write permission
			write reportText to newFile
			close access newFile
		end tell -- end tell front document
	end tell -- end tell application &quot;OmniFocus&quot;
end hazelProcessFile</pre></noscript>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/joebuhlig/7e3a15b1d75cc1d745e5.js"> </script>

<h2 id="ios">iOS</h2>

<p>You’ll notice in the script that I’m saving the text files to my DropBox. The most common place for me to search these task reports is from my phone. With them syncing and being stored with the rest of my <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/text-file-setup-and-workflow/">text file setup</a>, I can easily search for a task or project in Editorial and determine when I completed it.</p>

I’ve tweaked the look of Alfred quite a bit over the few years I’ve been using it.

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/Favorite-Alfred-Tricks.jpg" /><p>My Mac is useless without <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a>. That’s no joke. I try to use my wife’s profile once in a while. It’s painful for me and hilarious for her to watch. I keep hitting the Alfred shortcuts and staring at it like it’s broken.
<!--more--></p>

<p>I didn’t get this dependent overnight. I started using Alfred a few years ago and have slowly built up the number of use cases I have for it. So if you’re just starting out, don’t feel like you need to adopt a whole bunch of things at once. Find one or two that you know you’ll use and build from there. Here are some of the ways I use Alfred.</p>

<h2 id="launching-apps">Launching Apps</h2>

<p>I mentioned this in a <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/mac-navigation/">previous article</a>, but it bears repeating because it’s so important. I rarely use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_Control_%28OS_X%29">Mission Control</a> on the Mac. I’d rather jump straight to an app without hunting down the window that looks like the one I want. I set up workflows (Powerpack feature) that allow me to hit a keyboard shortcut and show/hide the app I want. This pulls up the app I want without a misfire.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts_extra/favorite_alfred_tricks/alfred-show-app-shortcut.jpg" alt="Alfred App Launch" /></p>

<h2 id="clipboard-history">Clipboard History</h2>

<p>I copy text and links all the time, and sometimes I need to copy/paste multiple portions of text at once. Take my weekly <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/newsletter">newsletter</a> for example. It has the title, excerpt, and link for each post that was published that week. I could flip back and forth nine times and get everything copied over, but that’s ridiculous. Instead I pull up each post, copy all the pieces I need, and use the clipboard history in Alfred to paste each piece without flipping between apps.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts_extra/favorite_alfred_tricks/alfred-clipboard-history.jpg" alt="Alfred Clipboard History" /></p>

<h2 id="email">Email</h2>

<p>I use Google Apps for my email and haven’t found a need for a local client because the web client works so well. This means checking my email requires entering the url for Gmail, and because I run a few different accounts I need to be able to pinpoint the exact email address. Using TextExpander, I set up a snippet that expands to the url for the account I want and presses Enter. Invoking Alfred and entering my snippet abbreviation sends me directly to my email. Though sometimes I wonder if I’ve made this too easy.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">xemp</code> = <code class="highlighter-rouge">https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox%key:enter%</code></li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">xemjb</code> = <code class="highlighter-rouge">https://mail.google.com/mail/u/1/#inbox%key:enter%</code></li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">xemfh</code> = <code class="highlighter-rouge">https://mail.google.com/mail/u/2/#inbox%key:enter%</code></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="searching-files">Searching Files</h2>

<p>This is a pretty standard way to use a launcher like Alfred. And if you’re just getting started with one, it’s a good place to start. If I need to open a file, I rarely go to Finder. I almost always start typing into Alfred.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts_extra/favorite_alfred_tricks/alfred-file-search.jpg" alt="Alfred File Search" /></p>

<h2 id="font-awesome">Font Awesome</h2>

<p>Because I develop for the web, I use the <a href="https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/">Font Awesome</a> library of icons a lot. It’s a part of nearly every website I’ve worked with. So when I ran across a <a href="https://github.com/ruedap/alfred2-font-awesome-workflow">workflow</a> for searching and pasting in the classes for every icon, I installed it immediately.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts_extra/favorite_alfred_tricks/alfred-font-awesome.jpg" alt="Alfred Font Awesome" /></p>

<h2 id="dictionarythesaurus">Dictionary/Thesaurus</h2>

<p>I find myself looking for synonyms and definitions quite a bit, and Alfred makes it really easy on me. It has a built-in mechanism for searching the dictionary for a word and offering synonyms. I did change the keyword needed to search the dictionary from <em>define</em> to <em>def</em>,  just to make it a bit quicker.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/posts_extra/favorite_alfred_tricks/alfred-define.jpg" alt="Alfred Define" /></p>

<h2 id="somedaymaybe-lists">Someday/Maybe Lists</h2>

<p>Because I keep so many idea lists, I wanted a quick way to pull them up. So I created a workflow in Alfred that uses the keyword <em>ofsm</em>. It opens a link (copied from OmniFocus) to my folder of Someday/Maybe lists.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/Text-File-Setup-and-Workflow.jpg" /><p>Now that I’ve moved <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/an-alternative-to-evernote/">away from Evernote</a>, the primary way I store information is through text files. It’s taken me a while to get it nailed down but I’ve managed to simplify the number of apps I use and the flow of text across my devices.
<!--more--></p>

<h2 id="file-storage">File Storage</h2>

<p>The back end storage of my text files is DropBox. It’s ubiquitous. If you want to build an app that handles raw text, you have to enable DropBox syncing to get any traction. Inside my DropBox structure is a folder, <em>Text</em> (original, I know). Within that folder are a few subfolders: <em>TaskReports</em>, <em>Weather</em>, and <em>Writing</em>.</p>

<p>The main folder, <em>Text</em>, is where the bulk of my files go.  I use the same naming structure here that I use in many places across my apps and devices: <code class="highlighter-rouge">Tagx_Keywords_YYYYMMDD</code>. The tag is the type of text the file contains. It uses <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/simple-trick-naming-tags/">the “x” trick</a> I adopted from Merlin Mann. I try not to add new tags but sometimes it’s necessary. Here is the current breakout of tags I’m using:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Bookx</strong> - book reviews and notes</li>
  <li><strong>Ideax</strong> - ideas I have for a project or potential business prospect</li>
  <li><strong>Inboxx</strong> - temporary files that need further processing</li>
  <li><strong>Monthlyx</strong> - monthly reflections</li>
  <li><strong>Presentationx</strong> - outlines and notes for presentations</li>
  <li><strong>Recipex</strong> - my personal recipe box</li>
  <li><strong>Thoughtsx</strong> - sometimes I write my thoughts about a concept or big decision</li>
  <li><strong>Topicx</strong> - potential topics for online forums</li>
  <li><strong>URLx</strong> - groups of urls I want to keep</li>
  <li><strong>Weeklyx</strong> - weekly reflections</li>
  <li><strong>Yearlyx</strong> - yearly reflections</li>
</ul>

<p>After the tag are keywords I use to describe the file itself. If I have an idea file for a client website, the title would look like this: <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ideax_clientwebsite.com_20160314</code>. Or if the ideas are for a potential business opportunity: <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ideax_Best solar panel ever_20160314</code>. Having these keywords makes it possible to search the tag and one of the keywords so I can find an exact file. But more often than not, I don’t need to search for the tag itself because typing in the keyword gets me close enough to look through the list of results and see the one I want. The tag helps me make that decision within the filtered list.</p>

<p>The keywords are followed with a date so I know when it was started. I almost never use this, but if I’m trying to put the file in the context of time, it’s invaluable. And because I create <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/textexpander-snippet-nomenclature/">date strings with TextExpander</a> it’s easy to append them to each file.</p>

<h2 id="accessing-files">Accessing Files</h2>

<p>Let’s talk apps. On iOS, I’m using <a href="http://omz-software.com/editorial/">Editorial</a> (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/editorial/id673907758?mt=8&amp;at=1l3vnyQ">iTunes</a>). It has a lot of power behind it and gives me access to my subfolders. There are a lot of great apps for working with text as Brett Terpstra has <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/ios-text-editors/">helped us see</a>, but I find that the ease of searching for text in Editorial paired with its integration with TextExpander makes it the perfect choice for me. Knowing that I can build workflows for text files is a huge plus as well. It feeds my need to be flexible with my data.</p>

<p>On the Mac, I use <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/2013/06/08/nvalt2.2b106/">nvALT</a> and <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a>. If it’s a quick note that doesn’t belong in a subfolder, I use nvALT. The speed of this app is just incredible. And once you learn some of the keyboard shortcuts, you can pick up a lot of speed in navigating your text files.</p>

<p>Any coding or writing that’s article length or longer is opened with Sublime Text, my heavy duty text editor. I always have a Sublime window open to my <em>Writing</em> subfolder of text files. Within that folder are breakouts for the different types of writing I do: Articles, Books, Podcasts, etc. Because these are all in one folder, I always know where to go when it’s time to write. And with the power that comes with Sublime, I have a lot of tools to make text easier to work with.</p>

<h2 id="collecting">Collecting</h2>

<p>Any time I need to write down text on iOS, it starts in <a href="http://agiletortoise.com/drafts/">Drafts</a> (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts-4/id905337691?mt=8&amp;at=1l3vnyQ">iTunes</a>). There’s great flexibility in creating custom actions to send that text almost anywhere. The last thing I want to worry about when writing it down is where it should go. I need to get the idea out of my head, not waste time determining where that text should land before it’s written down. If I have to do the latter, there’s a good chance I’ll lose a portion (or all) of the idea.</p>

<p>The vast majority of the time I don’t collect ideas on the Mac. Even when I’m typing away on an article and an idea comes to me, I grab my phone and enter it into Drafts. But if I do collect it on the Mac, I use nvALT. It’s super fast, but to make sure I don’t lose the text in my sea of files, I use TextExpander to name the file with the <em>Inboxx</em> tag so I can find it later.</p>

<h2 id="processing">Processing</h2>

<p>Once the text has been captured I need to get it to the right place with the right name. It’s pretty easy to do that with Drafts. I have a handful of actions to create new next files in DropBox. Choosing the right action dictates the subfolder and name of the file itself. This is the main reason I prefer to type things into my phone over the Mac. It’s a bit weird to say, but sometimes iOS trumps OS X.</p>

<p>Processing on the Mac isn’t anything out of the ordinary. I search nvALT for the <em>Inboxx</em> tag and do the cut/paste/rename routine you would expect. I use TextExpander to make that a bit easier, but I still prefer my phone.</p>

<p>In the end, this system allows me to be extremely flexible with the type of information I write down and gives me a lot of power when editing it later. I’m not locked into any one app or service, and the apps I’m using to interact with the text all have power user features available to create my own custom environment. I guess you could say I’m a control freak with my files, but this system gives me the level of micromanagement I’m looking for.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/Choosing-the-Right-Medium.jpg" /><p>You’re reading them right now. And the medium that they arrive in will change their weight. Words. Words in email have less impact than a handwritten letter. And a conversation over coffee has more sway than a phone call.
<!--more--></p>

<p>We use a lot of mediums to share words with each other. We can send written words over iMessage or paper; we can send audible words over Facetime or in person. Each method has its own connotations and perceptions. Add in differing cultures, generational differences, and regional expectations and we now have a mess on our hands.</p>

<p>But if we boil down the options, we see many similarities.  Sending short, typed messages can be done through Twitter, Snapchat, iMessage, or email. Long form text is best sent through a blog post, email, or a handwritten letter. Email can do both, and iMessage can also do audio. Here’s a breakdown of these types of words:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Length</th>
      <th style="text-align: center">Type</th>
      <th style="text-align: center">Mechanism</th>
      <th style="text-align: center">Example</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Short</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">Digital</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">Visual</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">Twitter, Snapchat, iMessage</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Long</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">Digital</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">Visual</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">Email, Blog Post</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Short</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">Analog</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">Visual</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">Thank You cards, Love notes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Long</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">Analog</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">Visual</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">Letters, journaling</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Short</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">Digital</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">Audible</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">iMessage, voice notes</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Long</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">Digital</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">Audible</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">Podcasts, talk radio</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Short</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">Digital</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">A/V</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">FaceTime, Snapchat</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Long</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">Digital</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">A/V</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">FaceTime, podcasts</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Short</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">Analog</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">A/V</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">Restaurant ordering</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Long</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">Analog</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">A/V</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">Meeting a friend for coffee</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Deciding which medium to use can be difficult. Some, like Twitter or Snapchat, are more comfortable because they don’t require vulnerability from me. Others, like a conversation over dinner, are a risk because I may say the wrong thing. And once it leaves my mouth it cannot be erased or crumpled up and thrown away.  But there are a number of factors to consider when making the decision, and comfort level isn’t really up for consideration. As long as I consider the medium that is most appropriate regardless of my own preferences, the message will be better conveyed with less chance of misunderstanding.</p>

<h2 id="publicity">Publicity</h2>

<p>Is it appropriate for the whole world to know about it? If yes, then you can use social media or a blog post. Or maybe you hold a press conference to broadcast it. But if it needs to be a private conversation or it’s a sensitive topic, please keep it off of social media and send it directly to the person who needs to hear it. I hope that goes without saying.</p>

<h2 id="length">Length</h2>

<p>If you want to share a thesis regarding your philosophical views on politics, 140 characters on Twitter probably isn’t the best choice. iMessage is great if you just need a quick response about a meeting time. The point here is to make sure the medium you choose has the ability to clearly state your point. You’re trying to convey your thoughts. Make sure you’re able to do so with the mode you choose. And don’t shortchange it just because it’s easier on you. Be clear.</p>

<h2 id="sensitivity">Sensitivity</h2>

<p>I’m never on Facebook. I understand why people use it, but I have a hard time seeing all the inappropriate posts that should have been a phone call or a get-together between friends and family. Facebook can quickly became a way of posting gut reactions to the thoughts of others. I don’t need that kind of trash in my life.</p>

<p>If the words you need to share are sensitive, whether due to political tensions, family problems, misunderstandings, or strategic business matters, consider your medium carefully. Anything typed out and sent digitally has a higher probability of being misunderstood than sitting in front of the other person. The higher the sensitivity, the less margin of error allowed in interpretation.</p>

<h2 id="relationship">Relationship</h2>

<p>How close are you to the other person? The more you know each other, the less you need to say to convey your thoughts. My best friend and I do our best to meet for coffee every Friday. In order to confirm that meeting, we just send a coffee emoji to one another. If I did the same to someone who just started following me on Twitter, they would be dumbfounded. “I know he likes coffee, but what the…?”</p>

<h2 id="availability">Availability</h2>

<p>I don’t think any of us would argue that in-person conversations are the most effective, but sometimes that’s simply not an option. You have to stick with the mediums available to you.</p>

<h2 id="value">Value</h2>

<p>This is likely the most overlooked variable. How much value do you want these words to carry? I can text “I love you” to my wife, but if I write those same words at the end of a love note written on special paper with a fountain pen, they carry more impact. If I say those same words when we end a phone call they have less worth than at the end of a dinner date. There’s nothing you can do to change the value of the medium. It’s implicit in the method itself.</p>

<p>New methods of communication are always being created and trends have us trying new ways to connect at every turn.  It’s not always easy to choose the medium for your words, but the more time I spend writing and sharing words, the more cognizant I am of the value they carry in each medium.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/Behind-the-Scenes.jpg" /><p>Almost daily, I get an email from someone interested in how I have this site set up. “It’s not WordPress and Disqus. What are you using?” We can talk about that, but why not take it a few steps further? Let’s go from domain registrar to the reader.
<!--more--></p>

<h2 id="domain-name">Domain Name</h2>

<p>It all starts with the domain name and I use <a href="https://hover.com/w1JR5qkh">Hover</a> any time I’m buying a new domain. They handle the registration and make it easy to create any DNS records I need. I want a single place to manage my growing list of domains and since they have a valet transfer service and free WHOIS privacy, it’s a logical choice.</p>

<h2 id="hosting">Hosting</h2>

<p>All of my website hosting is done through <a href="https://m.do.co/c/b0f9f06b6067">Digital Ocean</a>. With their one-click installations, cheap prices, and ease of use, it’s hard to go with anyone else. I use them for clients when I can and have had a lot of great experiences. I used their one-click install for Discourse when I set up the <a href="http://discussion.joebuhlig.com">discussion site</a> and had it running in about 15 minutes. I would never have been able to do that without their services.</p>

<p>Outside of the website hosting, I also need to host the files used for <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/whaddyaknowjoe/"><em>Whaddya Know Joe</em></a>. For that I use <a href="https://www.libsyn.com/">Libsyn</a>. When I started, I knew nothing about the inner workings of podcasting. I did a lot of research and picked up a lot from the guys at <a href="http://5by5.tv/">5by5</a> and <a href="https://www.relay.fm/">Relay</a>. With their guidance, I landed on Libsyn. I upload the file to them, they give me a link to it, and I get a bunch of stats. But the important part is that they keep me from eating up my storage capacity at Digital Ocean.</p>

<h2 id="email">Email</h2>

<p>You don’t last long in this world without email. There’s no surprise here: I’m using Google Apps for my email and calendar. To be honest, I’m not sure what other legitimate options there are. Google works with everything and makes it all really easy.</p>

<p>But for my <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/newsletter/">newsletter</a>, I’m using <a href="http://eepurl.com/bSDEhv">Mailchimp</a>. I created an account with them when I started this site and I’ve always been impressed with their ease of use and integrations. It was a simple plugin when I was on WordPress and now it’s a custom form with other connections via API. It doesn’t seem to matter what route I go or how much I progress, they grow with me.</p>

<h2 id="analytics">Analytics</h2>

<p>I’ve been developing a sensitivity to privacy and the handling of reader information. As a reader, I want my information to be kept in a silo, not spread around for others to use. If I feel that way, I know there are some of you that feel the same. So I moved from the standard of Google Analytics to <a href="http://piwik.org/">Piwik</a>. They allow me to keep all the data collected in a database that is accessible only to myself. It goes nowhere.</p>

<h2 id="home">Home</h2>

<p>The domain is registered, hosting is in place, and I have email working. Let’s move on to the meat of the whole thing: the blog. It’s a static site generated with <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. I write my articles in Markdown and run them through the generator to get a static html webpage that is pushed to the Digital Ocean server. That webpage is what you see when you visit. It’s not creating the page on the fly and then displaying it. That’s why it loads so fast.</p>

<p>The theme I’m using is a custom build that I’m continually tweaking. The web continues to become more and more picture-heavy which is a challenge for developers. Text has always rendered faster and more efficiently than images so I use lazy-loading on the images to keep the speed up. That’s just one one example of altering and adjusting Jekyll to fit my design.</p>

<p>Jekyll users will likely notice that I’m running two separate blogs: one for articles and another for the podcast. I use categories and built a home page that is specific to each one. That makes it possible to then generate an <a href="http://discussion.joebuhlig.com/t/variety-of-rss-feeds/183?u=joebuhlig">RSS feed for each</a>, but also pull them back together into one feed.</p>

<p>The most common way to deploy a Jekyll site is with FTP. You do a manual copy-paste of the files generated by Jekyll and you’re good to go. That works, but it’s not very clean and I don’t like the idea of opening another application. It also doesn’t allow me to easily schedule posts. So for deployments, I set up <a href="http://capistranorb.com/">Capistrano</a>. I use it on other websites and have always had great success with it. Once set up, I can simply run <code class="highlighter-rouge">cap production deploy</code> and in about 10 seconds my site has been deployed.</p>

<p>I really wanted a way to schedule posts. This is one of the more complicated tasks in Jekyll since most users publish the post immediately. I tend to post on a schedule and want posts to come out at the same time every week. I also want the flexibility that scheduling provides. So I set up a cron job on the server that generates the site at five o’clock every morning. All I need to do is set the date of the post for the day I want it to go live. Jekyll won’t build the webpage for that post until that day, which means I can deploy it with a future date and it will remain unpublished until then.</p>

<h2 id="tools">Tools</h2>

<p>I run the <a href="https://tools.joebuhlig.com">Tools site</a> as a subdomain and it consists of a custom Rails/Postgres app that I maintain. I couldn’t find a system I liked for selling my book so I built it. Again, I use Capistrano for deployments to a Digital Ocean server to keep everything working in the same manner.</p>

<p>For the payment gateway, I use <a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com">Braintree</a>. They offer the first $50,000 in transactions free of any fees. And with an extensive number of Rails examples on GitHub, I felt fairly confident in my abilities to build on top of it.</p>

<p>Another step in ecommerce is email. It’s a big part that can’t be shortchanged, so I went with <a href="http://mandrill.com">Mandrill</a>. Mandrill is run by Mailchimp and they have a great reputation, so it made sense to connect the two. Any email that comes from the Tools site is run through them.</p>

<p>Because the Tools site is already wired for commerce and emails, I built a custom referral program that allows affiliates to get paid for any purchases that come from a custom link.</p>

<p>Finally, there is a section of the Tools site that is hidden from the general public. I have an admin section that allows me to create invoices for my clients. I had one in particular that wanted to pay me via credit card so I built this solution to enable it. I can create a payment with a designated url to share with my client. They pay their invoice from that link and it closes the loop (emails included) with both of us.</p>

<h2 id="discussion">Discussion</h2>

<p>This is the most recent addition to the site. At the bottom of each post is a section for comments. It’s an embedded topic from the <a href="http://discussion.joebuhlig.com">Discussion site</a>. This subdomain is an instance of Discourse that sits behind the comment piece. It does a lot more than that, but for the sake of this post we’ll stop there.</p>

<p>To embed the comments on each post requires the addition of code at the bottom of each webpage. I do a lot of testing on my local machine before I deploy, but I don’t want to add the code unless it is being pushed to production. To avoid the randomly creating topic threads or errors whenever I test, I created a block at the bottom of my post layout that only adds the embed code if I add <code class="highlighter-rouge">JEKYLL_ENV=production</code> when running <code class="highlighter-rouge">jekyll build</code>.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>I know there’s a lot going on here and if you don’t have a technical background there’s much of this that probably doesn’t make sense. Don’t worry. You don’t need to have this level of complexity in a website to have it functioning well. This is the path I use because I like the extra control and flexibility.</p>

<p>If you do have a technical background, you might notice one or more services here that might change in the near future (I’m looking at you, Mandrill). There are always changes to pricing and features that lead to potential switches, but for now I’m really happy with where things are.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/Using-GTD-as-a-Woodworker.jpg" /><p>Hobbies are great candidates for GTD. With all the commitments we tend to take on, free time to spend on our hobbies can be elusive. That means it’s helpful to have a system in place that keeps track of where we were and what comes next.
<!--more--></p>

<p>I enjoy working with my hands after a day of thinking. It shifts my mind from the executive mode to the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Organized-Mind-Thinking-Information/dp/0147516315">mind wandering mode</a> and helps me decompress. The primary way I like to work with my hands is through woodworking and DIY projects. Whether it’s trim in the house or a hutch for my mother-in-law doesn’t matter. I get a chance to create something from a tree - that’s what I love.</p>

<h2 id="longer-projects">Longer Projects</h2>

<p>Sometimes the projects I take on develop over a period of months (hopefully not years) and I need to keep these project plans and supporting materials around for some time. That’s where the reference materials and project goals come in handy. I can step away from it for a period and still come back to where I left off.</p>

<h2 id="thinking-ahead">Thinking Ahead</h2>

<p>For most of my furniture builds, I can lay out what the entire project will look like step-by-step. That’s good because the joinery involved often needs to be cut early on in the project even though I won’t need it for another 20 steps. Once I have a design determined, I work backwards to name every step in the build. This affords me the perspective to see where I need to make specific cuts in the process and ensure the entire project comes out according to plan. It requires me to think through it all up front, which is the point. I have a lot fewer “oops” moments when I’ve taken the time to think it through at the beginning.</p>

<h2 id="research">Research</h2>

<p>In most woodworking projects I try a new technique, either because it’s necessary or because I just want to try a new method. In both, I need to spend some time learning from experts in person or online. When I determine how I want to complete that portion of the build, I keep it in my digital filing structure that allows me to reference it when needed; I make sure I have the material as a link in the notes for that step in the build. The research makes each step a simple process and keeps the build moving much more efficiently than if I tried to do the learning mid-stream.</p>

<p>I hope this series has been helpful. I know it’s taught me more about the GTD process by forcing me to think through how it functions in different arenas. GTD is a life framework and a proactive way to approach our information-heavy culture.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/Using-GTD-as-a-Man.jpg" /><p>To be honest, I struggled with this article. I wanted to write it but wasn’t sure how to convey what I was thinking. GTD has helped me as a man more than I realized but the impact has been implicit, not obvious.
<!--more--></p>

<p>How do we quantify what a man is and nail down the tasks that make a man? What activities does a man engage in? Pinpointing those tasks is a challenge in our equality-driven society. We strive for equality between men and women, but at the end of the day we are physically and mentally different, which means we’re each suited best for different types of work. Neither is any more or less important than the other, but they are different.</p>

<p>Knowing my own mind and reading what other respected men have to say on the subject, I think it’s fair to say that there are roles that fit men best. It’s these roles that I want to develop, using the GTD framework to create the freedom and focus I need to do so.</p>

<h2 id="killing-inaction">Killing Inaction</h2>

<p>Atrophy is a real issue. If you stop working with a skill, your ability to use it will diminish over time. I find this to be <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/working-the-focus-muscle/">especially true of focus</a> and being able to stay on task. <a href="http://www.artofmanliness.com">Brett McKay</a> even suggests that <a href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/2016/02/29/idleness-kills-manliness/">idleness kills manliness</a>. The premise here is that we need to keep moving and continue looking for ways to develop our internal motivation. We need activity to keep us on our toes -  that’s where GTD steps in. We can use the structure of creating projects and choosing tasks to create this motivation. The specific project really depends on you and what you like to do. It also depends on the manly skills you enjoy using.</p>

<h2 id="manly-skills">Manly Skills</h2>

<p>But what are <a href="http://www.orderofman.com/skill-sets/">manly skills</a>? The stereotypical view of this might be swinging an ax or shooting guns and there’s some validity behind that stereotype. But it goes much deeper than that. The traditional view of manly skills can be generalized into skills of physical strength and violence. And those can be great skills to have, provided they are paired with wisdom and discernment (also manly skills). Without the latter, the former becomes dangerous. We need to develop our intellect, relationships, and leadership skills along with our physical abilities. The  tasks we commit to need to include meetings with other men, books that challenge our thinking, regular times for physical activity, and opportunities to lead our families. Choose projects that take you out of that comfort zone we all love.</p>

<h2 id="providing">Providing</h2>

<p>I find that I have a strong desire to be the provider for my family and I know I’m not alone. There are countless men I respect that admitted to feeling inadequate when they were without a job. And I know that when things are going well with my business I have a lot of confidence in what I do. When times are thin, I start to wonder about my ability to put food on the table. But GTD gives me an outlet for storing my ideas and creates a series of potential work that I can always kick off. It also helps me make better decisions about where to spend my time. It gives me a full view of my commitments and allows me to pick between them and stay on track.</p>

<h2 id="mentors">Mentors</h2>

<p>If you don’t have regular time spent with other men, do something about it. The absolute best way I’ve received support and ideas for how to be a better man and lead a better life is by spending time with other guys and talking through what’s going on. Get it on the calendar and keep it there. Find some guys to do life with.</p>

<p>Defining the tasks that make a man is not simple. Some are obvious and some are subtle, but they are all important. The GTD framework makes it possible for you to keep up with life and stay on top of your role and skills as a man.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/Using-GTD-as-a-Dad.jpg" /><p>One of the greatest things a dad will ever hear is the sound of his kids squealing in joy while they play games together. It’s energizing and pure pleasure to see the delight and sparkle in their eyes as they ask to “do it again!” Those are the memories that we hope to multiply.
<!--more--></p>

<p>But there’s a boogie man that creeps up in these moments: wandering thoughts about something else. This is usually work of some kind but it can also be the worry about an upcoming conversation you need to have with a friend or the wiring in the bathroom that needs fixed. I hate it. I want these focused times with my kids to be cherished and frequent.</p>

<h2 id="mental-freedom-again">Mental Freedom… again</h2>

<p>I have to fight against feeling that I can get away with being distracted because they’re just kids. That’s not fair to them. They deserve my full attention just as <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/using-gtd-as-a-husband/">my wife does</a>. And they’re smarter than we give them credit for. They can tell when you’re with them or not. I think kids have an innate <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/every-body-saying-book-review/">ability to read us</a> that they eventually unlearn. So it’s even more important that I keep my head clear of worrisome tasks. Having the GTD structure gives me a way to maintain that clarity.</p>

<h2 id="quantity-time">Quantity Time</h2>

<p>We’ve overdone this in the past, but we’ve found a good balance lately. We want to make sure that we have time together as a family each day. That means we spend a little time together after I get off work and then again from dinner until bedtime. Yes, there are other commitments that come up and we handle those, but we can usually plan on these times as a family. That means I keep those times on the calendar and my wife and I try to plan out our afternoons ahead of time. We know that we both need time to work on fun projects or to just step away for a bit. But we always come back together at the end of the day for dinner and fun before the kids’ bedtime.</p>

<h2 id="gifts-and-activities">Gifts and Activities</h2>

<p>I do the same for my girls as I do with my wife. I want to keep lists of possible gifts for my girls and activities that we could do together. Coming up with activities for kids can be exhausting if you don’t have an idea bank to pull from. Most of the time I can run with whatever toys the girls want to play with, but there are instances when a list to fall back on is extremely helpful.</p>

<h2 id="at-the-end-of-the-day">At The End of the Day</h2>

<p>I use GTD to help me remember all the important dates in my girls’ lives and keep track of a few Someday/Maybes. With the the other areas of my life under control, I know when I can take time for them and I can do it without worrying. As long as I continue trusting the system (and quit thinking I need to check my phone when I’m around them), I can focus on my girls and enjoy making them squeal.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/Using-GTD-as-a-Husband.jpg" /><p>I find it easy to let my marriage slide. We love each other so it should come naturally, right? Roses every Valentine’s, daily love notes, and genuine conversations each night. If that’s second-nature to you, I envy you.
<!--more--></p>

<p>Building and growing an intimate relationship with your spouse is a choice. If you’re going to choose to love her, you need to do something about it. You need to show it. Step up and make the sacrifices of time and energy to let her know you love her, even when you don’t feel like it. It’s a choice.</p>

<p>But we all show our love in different ways, different <em>love languages</em>. I won’t go into the details of these here but I think you can get the gist of what they are by their titles. If you want more detail on them, <a href="http://www.5lovelanguages.com/">check out the book</a>. Here they are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Words of Affirmation</li>
  <li>Acts of Service</li>
  <li>Receiving Gifts</li>
  <li>Quality Time</li>
  <li>Physical Touch</li>
</ol>

<p>Before you can use GTD to better your marriage, you’ll need to have an idea of how you and your spouse each prefer to be shown love. You do things for someone whose love language is <em>Quality Time</em> much differently than someone whose language is <em>Receiving Gifts</em>. In my case, I’m <em>Physical Touch</em> and my wife somehow manages to be a four-way tie for all the others (okay, not really, but they’re pretty closely ranked). So we’re opposites. You can <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/moody-profiles/uploads/profile/attachment/5/5LLPersonalProfile_COUPLES__1_.pdf">take the test</a> to find yours on the book’s website.</p>

<h2 id="anniversaries-and-birthdays">Anniversaries and Birthdays</h2>

<p>Let’s start with the obvious ones. Dates are important. We <em>have</em> to remember them. And even with all the help of my system, I still find myself putting things off until the last minute. Keep these dates on the calendar and create a project for them a month out or more. I have to do this a couple months ahead of time or I’ll fail to do anything at all.</p>

<p>In my case, I typically get my wife a gift and plan a night out in some form. That covers <em>Receiving Gifts</em> and <em>Quality Time</em>. It usually starts with a project for the event and a task that tells me to make a decision about what to do or research upcoming events that coincide.</p>

<h2 id="gifts">Gifts</h2>

<p>I honestly don’t know what I would do without GTD here. When crunch time arrives and I want to pick something up for my wife, I can never think of that thing she said she wanted. But with a Someday/Maybe list for gift ideas, all I have to do is look there and pick one. Sometimes I share items on this list with family members. It makes it really easy to answer the question, “What does Becky want for Christmas?” Giving gifts to my wife has a lot more impact. <em>Receiving Gifts</em> covered.</p>

<h2 id="finding-time">Finding Time</h2>

<p>But sometimes time is a better (and more affordable) gift. This fits the <em>Quality Time</em> bill, and it’s where the calendar really comes in handy. My wife and I share calendars with each other so we can see what’s coming up between us. Because of that we can work together to find time away from the house and kids. Or maybe we use the time after they go to bed to watch a movie together (or get way too many ideas from <em>Fixer Upper</em>) or talk about our day.</p>

<h2 id="day-to-day">Day to Day</h2>

<p>Little things can go a long way in our house. My wife really appreciates help with maintaining the dishes, laundry, plants, toys, etc… These play into <em>Acts of Service</em> for her. Some of these are second nature and I don’t need a system for them. They’re habit at this point, which is great since my wife loves having the help. But some of these, like watering the plants, require a recurring task in my GTD setup.</p>

<p>There are also some bigger things that come up irregularly that make things much easier on her. If I take on the taxes process, she can sleep a lot better. Without a project in place to handle all of those steps, we would be paying fines every time. I’m not interested in introducing that kind of stress in our relationship.</p>

<h2 id="mental-space">Mental Space</h2>

<p>The most important aspect of GTD for me is the mental space it affords me. When we sit down to talk or go on a walk, I can be there with her. Yes, I still worry about work sometimes and she can tell when I do. If I flex the system and write those thoughts down when they come, it allows me to focus on her, give her the <em>Words of Affirmation</em> that she needs and show her that I care. She’s my best friend. I want her to know and feel that.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/Using-GTD-as-a-Writer.jpg" /><p>It never fails. I’ll be mowing the lawn or riding my bike and that’s when it hits me. There’s nothing I can do about it. I wish it would leave me alone until I could do something about it, but there I am; trying to figure out how I’m going to write those lines down.
<!--more--></p>

<p>This hasn’t been an easy lesson to learn. Writing things down. I have a pretty good memory for tasks, so I always have this nagging voice telling me “I’ll just remember this one. I don’t need to get it out of my head. I can handle it.”</p>

<p>When I started writing I had a tendency - as many first-time writers do - to wait until the muse hit me and then get to work. When it comes, take advantage of it and write like crazy. When you’re tired or the ideas stop flowing, you stop, too. No point in continuing when the good stuff is gone.</p>

<p>But there were times when this flow started to creep up on me and I couldn’t do anything about it. I was at work or I was driving. The more writing I did, the more frequently this happened and the more frustrating it was to sit helplessly and watch my inspiration fly past uncaptured.</p>

<p>I’d been using GTD for a while but I was only beginning to understand the more subtle nuances and the freedom that it can create. Because it was helping me so much in other areas, I started to apply the principles and set up systems to help with my writing. I wanted to harness the creativity that couldn’t decide on a schedule.</p>

<h2 id="topics-and-stories">Topics and Stories</h2>

<p>If you don’t already know, I’m a big fan of <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/using-omnifocus-for-somedaymaybe-lists/">Someday/Maybe lists</a> and setting up a list of potential topics was one of the best things I could have done to help my writing. I could be talking to a friend or reading an article and an idea would come to me. Originally, I would think about it for a moment or two and then move on. I couldn’t do anything with it right now and if was a really good idea I wouldn’t forget it. Well, that was a lie I told myself. I forgot a bunch of them. These days I type it into Drafts and send it away to the ideas list for me to review later when I’m gearing up for a new article.</p>

<p>I also keep a list of stories. If something happens or a situation impacts me, I write a note about it. I don’t always know when I’ll use these, but if I’m writing and need a story to go with it, I can look here.</p>

<h2 id="managing-creativity">Managing Creativity</h2>

<p>This is hard. I never know when I’ll have a great idea for an article I’m working on, but I have a set time when I sit down to write. One side is sporadic and unpredictable. The other is structured and uniform. The key GTD principle here is <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/getting-things-done-capture/">ubiquitous capture</a>. I must have a way to grab those sentences or paragraphs when they come, and I need a way to grab them even when my hands are busy. Sometimes that means I’m <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/siri-to-omnifocus/">dictating into Siri</a> and sometimes it means I pull the car over. I know that if I take those few moments to use my system, I’ll end up with better words on the page. As a writer, I can’t pass that up.</p>

<h2 id="clear-mind">Clear Mind</h2>

<p>It’s taken me a long time to trust my system. I go through spells when I still want to keep everything in my mind even though I know it leads to trouble. But I always come back to it stronger and more devoted. I’ve gradually ironed out points of resistance and made it simple enough to use even when I don’t feel like it. I can appreciate the freedom my mind has when I sit down to write. When it’s time to work on articles in the morning I don’t worry about the other stuff I have to do. I don’t want that clutter jumbling my thoughts. I want <em>mind like water</em> so I can be free to let the words come.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/Using-GTD-as-a-Homeowner.jpg" /><p>Most of the time when I’m discussing GTD with a friend or online it’s in the context of getting more work done more efficiently. I agree that this is the easy target for the framework; our jobs and the work we do each day are the most pressing and stressing in our lives. We need as much help as we can get to stay on top of it.
<!--more--></p>

<p>Once you start to understand the nuances of GTD and you have a handle on your job, there are a couple paths you can take. You can coast and enjoy the peace that comes with having work off your mind. Or you can continue to find areas of your life to integrate into GTD. It’s not just for work, but life. And the area of life that most closely resembles the responsibilities of work - making this an easy transition - is homeownership or managing your household.</p>

<h2 id="small-stuff">Small Stuff</h2>

<p>I’ve found that you can never truly be done keeping up or improving your home. There are always light bulbs burning out and appliances wearing out over time. With the <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/seasons-tasks/">changing seasons</a> there are annual tasks that can sneak up on you when you aren’t paying attention. With the GTD mindset, these are pretty simple to handle.</p>

<p>When you see something that needs attention, either do it right away or write it down. You should have a place for these household tasks so that when you have time to work on the house (you do have a context for these, right?) you pull up this list and bring the house back up to date.</p>

<h2 id="the-projects">The Projects</h2>

<p>If you’re talking to your spouse and the two of you have an idea pertaining to the house, capture that as well. You need to keep an eye on these potentials. I wish I had started doing this sooner. Because I keep a list of these, I can often knock out a few at a time.</p>

<p>I’m currently working on some trim and finishing touches in our family room. We had an idea to add <a href="http://discussion.joebuhlig.com/t/heavy-duty-floating-book-shelves/192?u=joebuhlig">built-in bookshelves</a>, but we’ve also talked about adding a switch to our fireplace to eliminate potential issues with the remote we have for it. If the remote stops working, I want a fallback and since the remote is currently a bit finicky, I thought it best to go ahead and hard-wire it. With a list of these potential projects in place, I was able to see the work I wanted to do in the family room and bundle it together. It’s a lot easier to do the fireplace wiring now when I have a wall opened up than after I have everything painted and back in place.</p>

<h2 id="irregular-tasks">Irregular Tasks</h2>

<p>There are also infrequent tasks that you can’t let slide. We live in Minnesota and with that comes a cold winter. Our house has outdoor spigots that need to be turned off in the fall so they don’t freeze and burst the pipes… again. I don’t want to relive the memories of that lesson, so I keep tasks like these in an annual <em>Fall Maintenance</em> list. When it starts to get cold outside, I run through this checklist of pre-cold items to make sure we don’t have major issues later on.</p>

<h2 id="the-principles">The Principles</h2>

<p>At the end of the day, these are the same tenants of GTD that we’re used to. When something comes up or you have an idea about something around the house, write it down; put it into the system; trust yourself. Come back to it when your contexts allow, but make sure you have a dedicated context or a specific time for these things. They won’t magically happen just because you wrote them down. Use GTD to help you engage with the tasks around your house as well as work.</p>

What do we want them to learn? Will our traditions help them see the importance of our view of the world? Are they fun?
<!--more--></p>

<p>My wife and I have a number of yearly activities that we’ve adopted from our own parents, and we want to pass them down to our own kids. But why? Is it purely nostalgia or old-fashioned? Should we just let them go and come up with our own?</p>

<p>I don’t think we pass them on because of nostalgia. There might be a bit of that, but there’s something more. Each tradition we pass on has a background and a starting point. It wasn’t something that our grandparents just made up because it sounded fun (though I wonder sometimes). They started with a desire to remember an activity or value, or they just had a great time with family doing it.</p>

<p>Say you have a tradition of watching the football game on Thanksgiving with your cousins. How did that start? Likely, there was someone in the family that turned the game on one year to check the score. Someone else asked about it and the next thing you know you’re watching the game together. Since the game is on, a few others started to show an interest and the next year you plan to watch the game. The following year you’re upgrading your TV specifically for this event and so on. But it started with a mutual interest and a connection with a family member, and now it’s grown to be a thing in itself at Thanksgiving. You come together for a day and connect with family.</p>

<p>This reminds me of any male’s rite of passage into manhood. It’s a search that every guy goes through at some point and many cultures acknowledge it with a traditional challenge to the boy. If he completes the challenge, he becomes a man. If he fails, he remains a boy. The tradition teaches him to overcome something difficult to show that he is ready for manhood, and that lesson of triumph over a trial will give him the confidence and strength he needs in the future. Without it, he will constantly be searching for his place in society.</p>

<p>Our traditions are typically altered and perfected over time. They can become more intricate or more simple as they are enacted numerous times. That’s exactly what makes them so powerful. With years of iterations, they become rich with lessons about values and morals that make our families unique. That’s what I want for our girls. I want them to learn these lessons from our grandparents and parents and eventually teach them to our grandchildren. It’s one way for me to have a positive impact on the generations beyond me and leave a proud legacy.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/An-alternative-to-Evernote.jpg" /><p>I’ve been a supporter of Evernote for a long time. I’ve written a number of articles on it and convinced a number of friends and family to start using it. But I’ve run into some issues with it and it’s come time to throw in the towel. I’m leaving Evernote.
<!--more--></p>

<h2 id="why-leave-evernote">Why leave Evernote?</h2>

<p>It’s proprietary. There are a lot of ways this <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/21/">becomes an issue</a> in my daily workflows.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I capture ideas in Drafts and want to move that text to an article I’m writing. I can’t easily get it into Evernote without a copy/paste in some form.</li>
  <li>Uploading files to Evernote creates a mess when you want to edit them. This is primarily an issue on iOS. You have to monkey around with sharing the file to and from other apps to make it work and it usually creates new problems somewhere.</li>
  <li>I write in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">markdown</a> and want to convert it to html. There is zero support for markdown in Evernote.</li>
</ul>

<p>I could go on, but I think you get the point. If you’re good with their format and like using the Evernote apps for editing everything, it’s great. But the moment you need to share the information with a non-Evernote user or edit it with something outside Evernote, the mess quickly grows.</p>

<p>I understand there is a <a href="https://blog.evernote.com/blog/2015/07/20/meet-evernotes-next-ceo-chris-oneill/">new sheriff at Evernote</a>, but if I want to have the freedom to use any app I want with the information I’m storing, I need to step away. I’m sure there are good things coming with the change in leadership and I genuinely hope it works out for them. I know a lot of people that rely on and love their service.</p>

<h2 id="the-new">The New</h2>

<p>I looked into a number of alternatives to Evernote. <a href="http://www.devontechnologies.com/">DEVONThink</a> led the pack with its standard file database on the backend. But no matter which of these “all-in-one” solutions I looked at, they all either have a proprietary file format or they require (or highly recommend) you to use their own apps to work with your data. Neither of those requirements are something I’m willing to meet.</p>

<p>I’m ultimately looking for a way to access standard files from any app I choose. In the current app world, that means the information needs to be stored in raw text, images, or PDFs. In order for these files to be used by almost any app I choose, it needs to use DropBox as a backend. With those two criteria in place, it was pretty easy to whittle this down to a simple folder structure in DropBox.</p>

<p>I should note that I wanted this alternative to be something that is easy for others to use as well. I could build a new proprietary system or one that uses shell scripts and such, but that’s not easily picked up by folks who aren’t interested in scripting their Mac. I wanted this to be accessible.</p>

<h2 id="the-structure">The Structure</h2>

<p>The base of the system is a folder structure in DropBox. The folder that I use as an inbox becomes the center point for collection. This is identical to my methods in Evernote. It’s called <em>!nbox</em>. Unless it has a preprocessed location, information goes here for organizing later.</p>

<p>After the inbox, I treat the remainder of my folder structure much like I would my tags from Evernote. Client projects have a dedicated folder under <em>Clients</em>. Each podcast episode has its own folder under <em>Podcasts</em>. This isn’t complicated.</p>

<p>The one grouping that gets special treatment is <em>Writing</em>. I keep a folder for all my writing (articles, podcast scripts, book chapters, website alterations) which is linked to Editorial to make writing from my phone easier. This is also linked to a <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/writing-with-github/">local git repository</a> on my Mac which allows me to review changes from my editor.</p>

<p>The base file formats I’m working with are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Text files</li>
  <li>Markdown files</li>
  <li>Images</li>
  <li>PDFs</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s pretty easy to find apps (no matter your OS) that will work with these file types, and their broad use means new apps are always being created to pair with them. Just look at <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/ios-text-editors/">Brett Terpstra’s iTextEditors</a> to see how many options you have on iOS for editing text files. There’s a bunch, and they keep coming.</p>

<h2 id="capturing">Capturing</h2>

<p>Storing and working with the files is the easy part. Collecting things is where Evernote shines. It can be dead simple to get stuff into it, but once you step away from features like the Web Clipper, it gets more difficult. In this new setup, installing and using the DropBox app on all my devices eliminates most of the friction.</p>

<p>There are three main types of information I find myself capturing:</p>

<h3 id="1-web-pages">1. Web Pages</h3>

<p>Sometimes I want to come back to a website because it’s interesting; sometimes the design of the site intrigues me; other times I’m just gathering a bunch of research for a project. In all cases, I need to be able to save the webpage for later and I need to be able to do it from the Mac <em>and</em> iOS.</p>

<p>It’s pretty simple on the Mac. There is a menu item called “Export as PDF…” under the File menu. You can <a href="http://computers.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-set-up-custom-keyboard-shortcuts-on-your-mac--mac-176">map this to a keyboard shortcut</a> (look at step 5) to make it faster to access. In my testing, these PDFs are full-text searchable as well.</p>

<p>From iOS, I was a bit stumped on this. I was trying to use Workflow to pull it off and kept thinking about ways to convert html to a PDF. But I couldn’t get it to work right, and it seemed jumbled. Eventually I took a step back to think (which is what I usually need to do when things start looking muddled) and deduced that I simply wanted a way to share a PDF to DropBox. Then I remembered the “Save to DropBox” button in the Share Sheet. Hold on to your hats: It turns out that <em>this will convert the web page to a searchable PDF for you.</em> I was pretty darn excited to figure that out.</p>

<h3 id="2-images">2. Images</h3>

<p>Most pictures I collect are done through my phone. I used to send pictures to my Mac using AirDrop and then move them to DropBox later. But when I discovered the “Save to DropBox” trick, those issues were gone. It saves an image directly to DropBox.</p>

<p>If I do take a screenshot with my Mac, I save it to the inbox or put it where it belongs right away, depending on what I’m doing. Working with images on the Mac in this way isn’t much different than how I was using Evernote. They simply land in a new place.</p>

<h3 id="3-text">3. Text</h3>

<p>If I’m grabbing a quick note on something, it starts in nvALT (which is synced with DropBox). If it’s an article or something longer, it goes into a Sublime Text project (also synced with DropBox). In either case, I can access the text from my phone in Editorial.</p>

<p>When I think of an idea or a paragraph I want to add to an article and I’m away from my Mac, I start in Drafts. I always start there, sometimes it stays there for a while. When it’s time for the text to leave, I can create new text files out of it or send it to another app. There are too many options for what you can do with it from Drafts to spell them all out now. Again, options are gold, and I can do pretty much anything I want from here.</p>

<h2 id="in-the-end">In The End</h2>

<p>I still have a lot of work to do pulling 14,000 notes from Evernote. I’m looking for ways to export the data and move it over, but for now I’m happy with where I’m putting all the new. It gets me away from a proprietary format and makes it a whole lot easier to use the apps I enjoy.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/How-to-Create-Energizing-Rituals.jpg" /><p>I learned about creating rituals after I read <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/power-full-engagement-book-review/">The Power of Full Engagement</a> over a year ago. Since that time I’ve been figuring a few things out about building and implementing energizing rituals.
<!--more--></p>

<h2 id="what-and-why">What and why?</h2>

<p>We’ve talked about the difference between <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/routine-vs-ritual/">ritual and routine</a> before, but the gist is that a routine is similar to a checklist that you go through each day and a ritual is a series of steps you take (just like a routine) that you find energizing or bring you enjoyment. This is an important distinction to make when you start learning to <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/power-full-engagement-book-review/">manage your energy levels</a> instead of your time.</p>

<p>If you’ve ever achieved more in a day than you did the entire previous week, you know what I mean by energy levels. Sometimes we naturally feel super energized and get a lot done. Then we all have “those days,” when just checking email feels daunting. When you build energizing rituals into your day, you can start to manufacture those moments of flow; but they aren’t always simple to create.</p>

<h2 id="finding-energizing-activities">Finding energizing activities</h2>

<p>What are your favorite topics to bring up with friends? What are the little things that you like doing or using but can’t explain why? What time of day do you look forward to?</p>

<p>I have a thing for fountain pens. I just like the way they write and that they’re different. I like the quality of the pens I use and look for excuses to write things down when I have them around.</p>

<p>Building things with my hands has always been a joy for me. After working on the computer throughout the day, I love the creative process of turning a piece of raw material into something useful.</p>

<p>I’m also a fan of the outdoors. Anytime I go outside to tackle the elements, I come back with a sense of accomplishment and pride.</p>

<p>I tell you these to give you ideas. The first step of building these rituals is understanding yourself and what you like to do. I bet you can nail these down pretty quickly if you stop for a couple minutes and think about it. Or if you have a spouse or close friend, ask them. There’s a good chance they can tell you what you love to do faster than you can. They have a different perspective that gives them a clearer view.</p>

<h2 id="converting-routines">Converting routines</h2>

<p>Whether you realize it or not, you use routines every day. You get up in the morning and get ready for work. You get ready for bed at night. Maybe you have a routine of daily journaling or playing with your kids after work. In any case, most have at least a few instances when they do something similar every day. These are the routines in your life.</p>

<p>You’ll have to decide which ones to convert (more on that in a moment), but the idea is to take an already existing routine and turn a piece of it into a ritual by injecting one of those energizing activities into it.</p>

<p>I have a routine that I run through at the end of my work day to plan for tomorrow. Recently, I started to do this plan on paper using my fountain pens. I enjoy using them and it takes a small neutral task and transforms it into an energizing one.</p>

<p>As a family, we enjoy spending time together when I get off of work. In the summer, we often take long walks with the girls. It’s a chance for me to get outside, get some exercise, and have a great conversation.</p>

<p>In both of these scenarios, I’ve been able to take something that I’m already doing and inject something into it. It makes them more fulfilling and gives me energy for whatever comes next in the day.</p>

<h2 id="which-routines">Which routines?</h2>

<p>The big question here is which routines do I try to convert? You don’t want to do this for everything or you’ll run out of time in the day and likely be way too energetic. We all know that guy who is way over the top and needs to settle down. Don’t be that guy.</p>

<p>Here’s the question to ask yourself: what times in the day do I feel like watching YouTube? It’s at least a good test for me. I know that if the only thing I want to do is stop and blow a few hours cruising YouTube, it’s a good time for me to stop and do something energizing. It can be simple, like checking in at the <a href="http://discussion.joebuhlig.com">discussion site</a> or it can be bigger, like taking 20 minutes to grab a snack with my family. No matter which energizing activity you decide to do, do it at a time when you need to increase your energy.</p>

<p>One word of caution: don’t do more than one at a time. Introduce a single ritual and stick with it until it’s second nature. Just like habits, if you try to take on more than one at a time, they’ll be overwhelming and have a negative effect instead of a positive.</p>

<p>In the end, you’re looking for things to do every day that will give you the energy to be more engaged with the people you see and the work you accomplish.</p>

<!--more--></p>

<h2 id="the-budget-flaw">The Budget Flaw</h2>

<p>This is one of the flaws that most budgets face because they are weekly or monthly. But the timing doesn’t align with all the bills and wreaks havoc on the plan when you least expect it. Some bills come in monthly. Others come in annually or quarterly. But you normally won’t have an increase in income at the same time you have an unexpected or unplanned increase in expenses. It would be nice if it worked that way, but it’s wishful thinking.</p>

<h2 id="designated-funds">Designated Funds</h2>

<p>What if you had a fund set aside to pull from when these bills come in? You sometimes see these in company budgets: <em>designated funds</em>. They know that they’ll need to replace their employee computers some time in the future so they set aside dollars to pay for it when the need comes. This is exactly what we do to handle these abnormal bills.</p>

<p>I used to kick and scream about this because it cut into my <em>fun money</em> in a month, but I have to admit that it really helps stress levels. All that’s needed is some way to calculate and keep track of the allocated dollars in your budget. Create a separate fund for each of these bills and calculate how much you would pay if the bill was actually monthly (or weekly, depending on your budgeting period). That’s how much you need to pay yourself each period. When the bill comes in, just transfer the money you need into your budget for the month (increasing your income) and pay it. No stress involved.</p>

<h2 id="the-savings-tab">The Savings Tab</h2>

<p>I talked about this in the <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/time-and-dollars/">Time &amp; Dollars article</a>. There are items for my business that I know I will need to replace in the future. I want to upgrade my phone and computer regularly, so I need to put money into those designated funds in my budget. For the business budget, I’ve created a tab called Savings in the spreadsheet to handle everything for me (<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kDUSdsIKvtUnXxd4z9hgBQMUiht1oq_p6Iixl6dTyCU">see example budget</a>). It takes the amount of savings I have for the month, allows me to allocate it to each fund, and shows each fund’s balance.</p>

<p>The end goal here is to plan for these supposedly “unexpected” expenses. They aren’t truly unexpected when I know how much they will cost ahead of time and when they will be due. As long as I plan and save ahead, stress doesn’t have to enter the equation.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/The-Importance-of-Data-Visualization.jpg" /><p>It’s easy to present data in a summarized table, but what about turning it into a data visualization?
<!--more--></p>

<h2 id="what-is-it">What is it?</h2>

<p>Data visualization is the display of data in a picture. Its purpose is to give a clear and easily understood visual of what the data is saying. Understanding the story in a data set by looking at spreadsheets and raw data isn’t something most people are accustomed to or good at, so we rely on a visualized format of the data, typically a graph or chart,  to help us.</p>

<h2 id="false-perceptions">False Perceptions</h2>

<p>It is critical to do this well or we risk giving the viewer an <a href="http://data.heapanalytics.com/how-to-lie-with-data-visualization/">incorrect perception</a> of the story behind the data. The display should show what is going on behind the scenes and the focus should be the data, not your interpretation of the data. Following conventional graphing methods will make it easier for your viewer to understand it. If you ignore these conventions, you risk building a <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/bad-bar-charts/">bad bar chart</a> and deceiving your audience. You can get away with this if you do it subtly, but you’re sacrificing your integrity in the process and it will eventually come around to bite you.</p>

<h2 id="interpretation">Interpretation</h2>

<p>When the visualization is done right, it explains what is happening. It’s impossible to look through millions of data points and know how things turned out. We can do summaries of the data to help, but oftentimes the summaries are even too complicated. People are visual by nature so a picture helps us see what is going on and interpret the results more clearly.</p>

<h2 id="patterns-and-outliers">Patterns and Outliers</h2>

<p>When you take the time to pull together this picture, you might be surprised at the patterns that start to reveal themselves. There are times when you may not realize you have patterns in your data until you put it in picture form. There are also times when the visual helps you see something that stands out. Just like the unknown patterns, you may not be aware of an outstanding data point until you graph it.</p>

<p>Take the time to build a good display of data. You want it to tell an accurate story and paint a picture of what is really going on. And it may show you something you didn’t know before.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/Time-and-dollars.jpg" /><p>When I started my business, I wasn’t in a place to say no to anything. I needed to provide an income, and every little bit helped. But recently I’ve had to start deciding which activities are most worth my time and which ones need to be put aside.
<!--more--></p>

<p>This isn’t a decision I can make by sitting in front of a fire drinking coffee. As much as I like coffee, it’s not <em>that</em> good. I need some numbers to reveal the biggest (and smallest) returns on my time. I started <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/tracking-time-with-launch-center-pro/">tracking my time</a>, but I need to dig deeper than that.</p>

<h2 id="budget">Budget</h2>

<p>Every good business has a budget. And mine, H&amp;A Tech, is no different. Without it, I don’t know if I’m making money or losing money. This simple document has a line for income and separate lines for each type of expense I incur. At the beginning of each month I plan the expenses and expected income for the month, and I do what I can to stick to it. Any deviation can create issues for my family later.</p>

<p>This is pretty standard, but it deviates from the norm when I pull in transactional data. I have a second tab that accepts copy-pasted transactions from my bank. Once a month I pull in this data and then augment each line item with a client and activity. It sounds tedious, but with the help of a few filters similar transactions can be filled in simultaneously.</p>

<p>Because I’m correlating the transactional data with the budget categories, I can see a clear summary of each month. How well did I stick to the plan?</p>

<p>Then I have savings. With an online business comes subscriptions and those often have annual payments. I handle those with a savings tab in the spreadsheet, but that’s a topic for another day.</p>

<h2 id="google-sheet">Google Sheet</h2>

<p>This might be a bit hard to get your head around so I put together an example budget for you to look through. I keep my budget in a Google Sheet so I made a copy and cleared it out for you to see. Here are the tabs you’ll find in <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kDUSdsIKvtUnXxd4z9hgBQMUiht1oq_p6Iixl6dTyCU">the example</a>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Budget - the plan for the month (includes the summary)</li>
  <li>Transactions - the bank transactional data</li>
  <li>Savings - long term expenses and savings funds</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="from-budget-to-time-tracker">From Budget to Time Tracker</h2>

<p>The budget is in place and the <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/tracking-time-with-launch-center-pro/">time tracker</a> is tracking away. So I created a new tab in the time tracker to import the transactional data from the budget. With the data pulled over, I group the time and transactions by month, client, and activity using pivot tables. It looks like this:</p>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-small" src="/assets/posts_extra/Time and Dollars/time-aggregation.jpg" /></p>

<p>With the datasets each grouped in the same way, they can now be tied together into a single table. I do this with the SUMPRODUCT function as <a href="https://blogs.office.com/2012/04/26/using-multiple-criteria-in-excel-lookup-formulas/">explained here</a> which makes it a one-step process. Once the data is all in one place, I can run another pivot table to figure out where my time is most valuable.</p>

<h2 id="by-client">By Client</h2>

<p>Is my time better spent on my own projects or working for my clients? And the follow-up question: which clients give me the best return on my time? If I have a client that requires a lot of support and effort but there isn’t much for income to compensate, I either need to raise my rates or consider letting them go. It’s difficult to know about these situations without data. Once I have the information, I can make my decision with confidence.</p>

<h2 id="by-activity">By Activity</h2>

<p>The other segmentation I need to understand is the activity breakdown. What type of work has the highest monetary value? I ask this because I’m not sure if my return is higher when I write for myself or when I consult a client. By switching the pivot table to group by activity, I can see which types of work give me the highest returns and which ones I should consider scaling back.</p>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

<p>Setting this up can be labor-intensive, but I hope you see the value here. Working for yourself can bring a lot of opportunities your way, and knowing which ones to take on and which to pass by can be tricky. This process gives you real numbers to work with and makes it less of a guessing game.</p>

The idea is to help me decide which types of work are the most valuable. This is a look at how I’m doing the time tracking portion using <a href="http://contrast.co/launch-center-pro/">Launch Center Pro</a>.
<!--more--></p>

<h2 id="1-google-sheet">1. Google Sheet</h2>

<p>The data needs to live somewhere and I’m comfortable with Google Drive. So I created a new sheet with five columns:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>DateTime</strong> - Timestamp of when it was recorded.</li>
  <li><strong>Client</strong> - Who is the activity for? This is mostly “Joe Buhlig.”</li>
  <li><strong>Activity</strong> - Writing an article, recording a podcast, coding, etc…</li>
  <li><strong>Amount</strong> - How long was I doing the activity?</li>
  <li><strong>Notes</strong> - Any notes I have about it.</li>
</ol>

<p>With this format I can do roll-ups by client or by activity. It allows me to compare the time I spend on a client and the gross income from that client to determine my hourly rate. This makes it easy to know if my rates are where they should be.</p>

<p>It also helps me determine the types of work that are the highest paying. Doing a similar roll-up by activity will tell me if my time is better spent coding or consulting. But I have to be careful, because the answers can be a bit misleading. Writing articles for this site shows a zero for profit, but I know that writing is what brings people to my site. And in turn, that leads to sales elsewhere. So my conclusions are a judgment call, but it is helpful to have the data in front of me.</p>

<h2 id="2-ifttt">2. IFTTT</h2>

<p>To collect the data I’m using a single recipe in <a href="https://ifttt.com">IFTTT</a>. It adds a row to the Google Sheet each time the LCP action is triggered. By passing different parameters to the recipe, I alter the data that is entered into the spreadsheet.</p>

<p><a href="https://ifttt.com/view_embed_recipe/375147-time-tracking" target="_blank" class="embed_recipe embed_recipe-l_13" id="embed_recipe-375147"><img src="https://ifttt.com/recipe_embed_img/375147" alt="IFTTT Recipe: Time Tracking connects launch-center to google-drive" width="370px" style="max-width:100%" /></a><script async="" type="text/javascript" src="//ifttt.com/assets/embed_recipe.js"></script></p>

<h2 id="3-launch-center-pro">3. Launch Center Pro</h2>

<p>In LCP, I set up a different action for each activity I want to record. Each action uses the same url scheme to send the data on to Google. Here’s what it looks like:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">launch://ifttt/trigger?name={{TimeTracking}}&amp;value1={{Joe Buhlig}}&amp;value2={{Development}}&amp;value3=[prompt-num:Time in Mins]&amp;value4=[prompt:Notes]</code></pre></figure>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">name</code> parameter will always be the same: the Trigger Name in the IFTTT recipe. In this case, I’m passing my own name as <code class="highlighter-rouge">value1</code> because this particular action is for recording development work I do for myself. The last three values record the activity type, amount of time I spent on the task, and any notes I want to enter about it.</p>

<h2 id="in-practice">In Practice</h2>

<p>Whenever I start a new task, I start a stopwatch. When I finish the task or need to move on to something else, I stop the watch, open LCP, and select the action for the task I was working on. I enter the time and any notes about it and I’m done. This creates a new record in the Google Sheet that I can use for analytics later.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/A-new-discussion.jpg" /><p>It’s time. I’ve been talking about starting a new community for a couple weeks now and we are moving forward.
<!--more--></p>

<p>I’ve chosen Discourse as the engine behind the scenes. You can sign up at <a href="http://discussion.joebuhlig.com">discussion.joebuhlig.com</a>. To start, it will be really basic. My hope is that it will evolve into a community that can help each other out with tech and productivity questions and tips. Here are the categories I’m kicking it off with.</p>

<h2 id="comments">Comments</h2>

<p>This replaces the subreddit that I’ve been using. Each post will have a dedicated topic with replies embedded at the bottom of the post. This makes it possible to continually add to posts and see responses to the most popular questions without going to a different site.</p>

<h2 id="working-with-omnifocus">Working with OmniFocus</h2>

<p>This is a dedicated category for <a href="https://tools.joebuhlig.com/working-with-omnifocus/">the book</a>. Any questions about it or ideas for the next version go here.</p>

<h2 id="off-topic">Off Topic</h2>

<p>The majority of this site is based on technology and productivity, but sometimes I’d like to discuss interesting articles and topics that don’t really apply. This is where I’ll post them.</p>

<h2 id="meta">Meta</h2>

<p>This is a discussion about the discussion itself as well as this blog. If you have topic ideas or suggestions for how to improve the site or discussion, I’d love to see them here.</p>

<p>I am excited about building a community where we can help each other learn and grow. Come <a href="http://discussion.joebuhlig.com">check it out</a>!</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/Just-a-Laptop.jpg" /><p>When I started my business I made the shift from three 27” monitors to just a laptop screen. That shift has taught me a few things about how I work.
<!--more--></p>

<h2 id="different-modes">Different Modes</h2>

<p>I have different mindsets and needs when I’m doing different types of work. I can listen to upbeat music and kick back on the couch when I’m cycling through email, but I need instrumental, low-key music and my desk when I’m coding. These two examples were the extremes that made me start to pay attention.</p>

<p>Noticing those subtle differences has brought some pretty big gains in productivity. I used to rarely leave my desk because the monitors made it possible to see so much at once. When I only have the laptop screen it forces me to focus and choose the best (or most comfortable) environment.</p>

<h2 id="focus">Focus</h2>

<p>Forcing focus has paid big dividends in my writing. Because I don’t have the ability to see a whole bunch of things at once, I stick to the task in front of me. Since the time I’m most vulnerable to YouTube binges is when I sit down to write, this has paid off. I usually enjoy the process of writing but getting started is hard when there’s a Twitter feed staring at me from the corner.</p>

<h2 id="development">Development</h2>

<p>One area that has suffered is coding. It’s not uncommon for me to have three browsers open, multiple instances of Sublime Text, and multiple terminal windows running all at once. The ease of seeing a bunch of those at once is extremely helpful and allows me to work much more quickly and efficiently.</p>

<p>This isn’t my forever setup, but it is good for me to appreciate the advantages and acknowledge the limitations of working from “just a laptop.”</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/Dictating-vs-Typing.jpg" /><p>Dictation is becoming more and more commonplace, and as the software behind it continues to get better we’ll likely see it become a bigger part of our daily lives.
<!--more--></p>

<p>It takes some practice, but once you understand the mechanics, dictating can increase your time efficiency. From texting to getting the latest Chiefs scores, there are endless uses for the technology. I use Siri a fair amount and now that “Hey Siri” is wireless in the iPhone 6S, I’ve found my use cases increasing.</p>

<p>Because of Siri’s current accuracy, I decided to dictate the first draft of <a href="https://tools.joebuhlig.com/working-with-omnifocus/"><em>Working with OmniFocus</em></a>. I knew that I could get the ideas out of my mind much faster if I were able to simply speak them.</p>

<p>It was great. I plugged in my podcasting mic, turned on dictation, and went to town. I could draft an entire chapter in about 90 minutes. In 6 days I had finished the entire first draft. It felt awesome to be able to do so much in so little time.</p>

<p>When I reflected on that process I realized that I spent a lot of time trying to find the specific words I wanted instead of working to get the ideas out of my head. I was able to input the words so quickly that I had a hard time coming up with the words I wanted. This by itself really isn’t a big deal, but it meant that I needed to find a way to pre-process my thoughts ahead of time.  In the end I spent an hour writing or typing my notes for each chapter before I dictated them, so there wasn’t much for time savings.</p>

<p>Since the dictation wasn’t 100% perfect, I spent quite a bit of time deciphering my original intent when editing. Not only was I trying to improve the sentences and paragraphs, but the words themselves were so far off at times that I couldn’t figure out what I was talking about and ended up rewriting the whole thing anyway.</p>

<p>More practice would likely improve my dictation, but the slower pace of typing gives me time to process my thoughts more clearly and reduce editing later. It helps me gain clarity faster and spend more time refining the ideas than the process. I will continue to use dictation for smaller chunks, but in my case anything long-form is better suited to typing.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/Mac-Navigation.jpg" /><p>Nerdy Mac users are known for customizing their machines. Between keyboard shortcuts, Spaces, and third-party apps, you can effectively set up a computer that is perfect for you and unusable by someone else.
<!--more--></p>

<p>But folks don’t typically think about how they move from one application to another. Mission Control or Spaces are the standard solutions. I’ve found that Spaces doesn’t work well because it forces me to pull my hands from the keyboard to the trackpad. And I can never find the app I want in Mission Control.</p>

<h2 id="hiding">Hiding</h2>

<p>I’ve developed a process of showing and hiding apps, making it possible to immediately switch to the app I want by hiding the one I was just using. I use the built in shortcut Command-H to hide an application from view. It doesn’t close the application, it just moves it to the background. I can get back to it in a couple ways, by using Spotlight or by clicking on the app icon in the dock.</p>

<h2 id="alfred">Alfred</h2>

<p>But I prefer to use my launcher of choice, <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a>, to bring it back. I can invoke Alfred, type the name of the application I want, and keep moving. To make it even faster, I set up a few shortcuts for commonly used programs so I can go directly to the app I want. For example, I can hit Control-Option-O to pull up OmniFocus. Control-Option-F will open Finder and Control-Option-T opens Sublime Text. They all start with Control-Option to make it easier to remember.</p>

<h2 id="in-practice">In Practice</h2>

<p>Anytime I need a different app, I either type the Alfred shortcut or type the name of the app into Alfred. When I’m done with it, I hide it or repeat the process to open the next one. Just remember to close them when you’re done or your computer will be as slow as a slug.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/Dvorak-Transition.jpg" /><p>I’ve had an interest in the Dvorak keyboard layout for a couple years now. The concept makes sense to me and I’m finally doing something about it.
<!--more--></p>

<p>For those not familiar with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard">Dvorak</a>, it’s a simplified keyboard layout that is designed to reduce finger motion and errors. And by association, many proponents claim faster typing speed as a result.</p>

<p>I’m very interested in the typing speed claims, but I’m also intrigued by the idea of preemptively combating RSI. I don’t have any major issues right now, but as someone who makes a living by typing I can’t afford long-term degradation.</p>

<p>When it’s all over, I would like to know if the switch was worth it. But measuring finger movements would be pretty difficult. It would require setting up cameras and running the video through a sensing algorithm to determine the distance my fingers travel while typing a lot of text. And since Dvorak is already built to reduce motion, I don’t see the point. I would be trying to prove it was correctly designed. So instead, I’ll be measuring my typing speed to get a comparison.</p>

<p>I’m a data junky and want to make sure I have good numbers. But this case is complicated. I use two different keyboards in two different locations for most of my typing. I use the built-in keyboard in my MacBook Pro (MBP) when I’m writing from the couch and an Apple Wireless Keyboard (AWK) when I’m at my desk. Those scenarios rarely deviate, so I’ll be testing each instance.</p>

<p>I needed a baseline, so I started with the QWERTY keyboard I’m used to and picked four texts from <a href="http://www.typingtest.com/">typingtest.com</a>. I ran two rounds of two minutes from each keyboard/location. I started on the couch with the MBP and did two rounds of two minutes and then moved to my desk for another two rounds.</p>

<p>However, I have one issue with this: timing. I’ve always felt that my speed tends to fluctuate from the morning to the afternoon. I did the initial testing in the morning so I did another round in the afternoon. And because I like be extra sure of things, I repeated the whole process two days in a row. All of this was done from the QWERTY keyboard before switching anything to Dvorak. No need tainting the waters.</p>

<p>I was surprised to see very little difference between the MBP and the AWK. Overall, my average QWERTY typing speed was 72 wpm. Not bad.</p>

<p>Once I had all of my numbers on QWERTY, I added a <a href="http://kbcovers.com/dvorak-keyboard-cover">keyboard cover</a> to my MBP and switched everything over to Dvorak. I made the switch cold turkey and won’t be trying to maintain QWERTY at the same time. And in the interest of good data, I repeated the entire process above on Dvorak.</p>

<p>I have a long way to go before I reach my initial QWERTY speed. My hope is that going all-in with Dvorak will help me get there quicker. It’s all for the sake of faster and more efficient typing.</p>

<h2 id="working-with-omnifocus">Working with OmniFocus</h2>

<p>This is my favorite accomplishment of 2015. I had been wanting to write a book for a long time but never had the time. It seems that there were a lot of you interested in reading it as well. In two short months, there were 667 copies of <a href="https://tools.joebuhlig.com/working-with-omnifocus/"><em>Working with OmniFocus</em></a> sold! I wasn’t expecting anywhere near that number when I started, and I’ve been overwhelmed by the feedback. Thank you.</p>

<h2 id="ha-tech">H&amp;A Tech</h2>

<p>In August, I left the company I was working for and started my own business. It was a fast and unnerving transition, but I’m thrilled to be where I am today. I’m able to work on the projects I love and build things with little or no delay. If I get a crazy idea, I can pursue it without worrying about politics or the red tape of company approvals. I wish I could have done this sooner.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/Writing-a-Book-with-GitHub.jpg" /><p>A lot of time and effort go into writing a book. It gets even harder when you need to collaborate with your editor and make revisions.
<!--more--></p>

<p>All of the edits must be reviewed and approved. Do you keep the change or do you toss it? Multiply this by hundreds of edits (or in my case thousands) and the task is enormous. Even when you think you nailed a paragraph, it can come back shredded (that means it’s better in the end, right?).</p>

<p>When I wrote <a href="https://tools.joebuhlig.com/working-with-omnifocus/"><em>Working with OmniFocus</em></a> I used GitHub to manage all of the revisions and help me see the edits. I was doing all of my writing for the blog in Markdown and I didn’t want to change that workflow for the book.  It turned out to be a great choice.</p>

<h2 id="file-layout">File Layout</h2>

<p>I kept the file structure for the book really simple. A single markdown file for the outline and a single file for each chapter. I wrote the first draft for the entire book before I went back to start editing. When I finished editing each chapter I uploaded a copy of it to a DropBox folder I share with my editor. That allowed her to get started while I kept editing the later chapters.</p>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-tiny" src="/assets/posts_extra/Writing a Book with GitHub/file_structure.jpg" /></p>

<p>I created a local git repository on my computer with the GitHub for Mac application. I could do it via command line, but I like the UI that comes with the app. Every time I made edits to the book, I committed the changes to save a history of the work I was doing.</p>

<h2 id="receiving-edits">Receiving Edits</h2>

<p>When my editor finished each chapter, she let me know via email or text. I created a new branch in my local repository that I used to overwrite my version of the chapter with hers. That gave me her edits on my machine with the GitHub application waiting for me to merge those changes. I read through each edit and made decisions.</p>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-small" src="/assets/posts_extra/Writing a Book with GitHub/github_edits.jpg" /></p>

<p>It was simple to see any adds, deletes, or comments that she made. The interface clearly showed what had been done to the file. If I needed to revise what she had done, I could jump over to the file in Sublime Text, make the edits, and save it. When I was done acting on her edits, I committed the changes and then merged them into my master branch in GitHub.</p>

<h2 id="version-history">Version History</h2>

<p>A big benefit of this process is the version history. I can look back on every commit I have made and roll back to that point in time. It keeps each revision and allows me to come back to them as needed. This is a huge load off of my brain. I don’t have to worry about making a change - I know I can always undo it or look back on what I did and see the progression.</p>

<p>I plan to use this method for any books I write in the future. I use GitHub quite a bit, so I’m comfortable with it and it makes the editing process painless. Well, at least logistically.</p>

I climb back on the horse, but fall off again. It looks easy - and it is at times - but other times it feels like one more item on my to-do list.
<!--more--></p>

<p>All of the apps and systems are nice, but I go through seasons with them. People see my systems and might think I have it all together. I don’t. I forget things all the time. It’s why I gravitate to the structure: it gives me a place to put things so I can come back to them.</p>

<p>There are times when I fail to stick to them. It’s at those times that I drop the ball and miss a deadline, or disappoint my family. It sometimes takes a painful reminder to push me back into the lists. I know I can trust them, but I don’t always.</p>

<p>But the time I spend away from them is continually growing shorter. I climb back into the cockpit more quickly each time. If I continue to collect my thoughts and do something about them, I know they’re taken care of. I know that I can go play with my girls without being concerned about work.</p>

<p>Here is one of the deterrents to GTD: You put a system together, but a big urgent project comes up and you put the structure aside. A month goes by before you notice that thoughts about work are invading your family time and that when you’re at work all you want to do is go home. You come back to the system and start to find clarity again.</p>

<p>It takes time to trust the system in all seasons. I would say it takes years of developing your personal system before you can trust it in every circumstance. This ongoing cycle of leaving and returning builds the trust you need to mentally let go.</p>

<p>Develop a system you can trust and let loose.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/Bad-Bar-Charts.jpg" /><p>In previous roles I worked on data analysis and visualization. When you boil it down, that just means I was well versed in Excel and building charts.
<!--more--></p>

<p>I love the challenge of working on a chart until it displays the data honestly. That also means I notice bad designs in charts. There are many ways to skew results with chart design and they all make me see red. If you see a chart with one of these aspects, either ignore it or rebuild it.</p>

<h2 id="non-zero-based-scale">Non-Zero Based Scale</h2>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-small" src="/assets/posts_extra/Bad Bar Charts/nonzero_baseline.jpg" /></p>

<p>This is one of the biggest culprits in bad charts. It’s easy to change the baseline of a chart and make it look like there’s a big difference between two segments. In the chart above, it looks like “Unsure” is drastically overpowering the “Unlikely” category. But if we change the chart to a zero-based axis, we can see that the difference is fairly small.</p>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-small" src="/assets/posts_extra/Bad Bar Charts/zero_baseline.jpg" /></p>

<p>Now it’s a lot harder to see the difference between the categories, but it provides a more accurate picture of what’s going on because the visual matches the real data.</p>

<h2 id="varying-width-bars">Varying Width Bars</h2>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-small" src="/assets/posts_extra/Bad Bar Charts/bar_width.jpg" /></p>

<p>This is more subtle but it can make a big impact on how the outcome is perceived. If you make the already taller bars wider than the others, you increase the visual effect on the viewer and leave them with an exaggerated perception of the data.</p>

<h2 id="unnecessary-lines">Unnecessary Lines</h2>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-small" src="/assets/posts_extra/Bad Bar Charts/extra_lines.jpg" /></p>

<p>In the same way that a non-zero based scale alters the view of the data, a scale that goes too high can also mislead you to thinking there is no difference between two data points. You want the scale to go from zero to the lowest possible number while still allowing room for the entirety of  the bars.</p>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-small" src="/assets/posts_extra/Bad Bar Charts/removed_extra_lines.jpg" /></p>

<p>We can now see that Minnesota has a decent lead on the others. But we couldn’t draw that conclusion until the scale was set appropriately.</p>

<h2 id="inconsistent-scale">Inconsistent scale</h2>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-small" src="/assets/posts_extra/Bad Bar Charts/inconsistent_scale.jpg" /></p>

<p>If you don’t have all the data points (or don’t like them), you either need to forego the chart entirely or be honest. I have seen a similar chart used to show exponential growth of membership when in reality the membership growth rate was fairly consistent. Don’t lie with the data.</p>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-small" src="/assets/posts_extra/Bad Bar Charts/consistent_scale.jpg" /></p>

<p>When you include all of the data points, you can see a big difference. Your perception of the first is that the pace is picking up fast. The second chart shows that the rate of increase is normalized.</p>

<h2 id="3d">3D</h2>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-small" src="/assets/posts_extra/Bad Bar Charts/3d.jpg" /></p>

<p>This is just bad design. It’s hard to get a feel for the difference in the bars because our eyes are trying to follow the perceived lines on the chart. And it looks bad. Don’t do it.</p>

<p>Overall, these are really simple fixes. But they can have a major impact on the viewer and how they perceive the data. Don’t lie with a visual. If the data doesn’t show what you want, then you have bigger decisions to make. Get to work and change your methods to get to your desired outcome. Don’t fabricate positive results.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/Merry-Christmas-2015.jpg" /><p>I’m thrilled to give you a gift for Christmas this year. I’ve wanted to do something like this for a long time and the opportunity is finally here.
<!--more--></p>

<p>I enjoy helping others and I’ve heard from a lot of people that <em>Working with OmniFocus</em> has finally showed them the tools they needed to put their life in perspective. Folks have shared stories about being able to start a business because of the principles shared in the book. One reader found treatment for a serious illness in their child because they were able to work clearly with the doctors. That blows my mind.</p>

<p>If you’ve been on the fence about buying the book, want to give yourself a Christmas present, or know someone who might benefit from reading it, here’s a discount code for you to use when buying <a href="https://tools.joebuhlig.com/working-with-omnifocus/"><em>Working with OmniFocus</em></a>. Use the code <code class="highlighter-rouge">Christmas15</code> when filling in your information and it will take $5 off the price. The code will be valid through the day after Christmas.</p>

<p>And if you’re willing, send me your story. I love hearing from you. Merry Christmas!</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/Monthly-Planning.jpg" /><p>We’re sneaking up on the annual goal setting push. It’s exciting to sit down and dream about what you want to do next year. But what if your life moves and changes too fast for annual goals?
<!--more--></p>

<p>Setting goals is something <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/an-alternative-to-annual-goals/">I’ve struggled with</a>. And it has generally been instigated by the company I worked for. I went through the typical annual review process when I worked in corporate and at the virtual company I worked for. You find it just about everywhere.</p>

<h2 id="annual-expectation">Annual Expectation</h2>

<p>It always felt like I did it because I <em>should</em>. I even completed a similar process personally because I thought it was the silver bullet to achieving more. I was wrong.</p>

<p>Annual planning doesn’t work for me. That’s one reason I’ve always struggled with it. Putting a plan together for how you’ll build new technology is fun, but often very inaccurate. It moves quickly and you learn a lot in the building process. That typically means that when 12 months have passed, I’ve discovered a new area to work on that is more beneficial or more advantageous. Year-end reviews typically involved a discussion of why I didn’t hit the original goals.</p>

<h2 id="move-to-monthly">Move to Monthly</h2>

<p>12 months is simply too long in my world. So I’ve scaled it back. I still set goals, but I turn those into projects and plan them month by month. And most of those projects are only two or three months long.</p>

<p>Because I can usually see the next two - sometimes three - projects that are coming up, I go ahead and plan those out. I’m only looking at the next seven or eight months at a time, and even those later months will typically change a few times before I complete them.</p>

<h2 id="what-it-looks-like">What It Looks Like</h2>

<p>I keep a simple list of my monthly goals. Each goal is a single line item with a brief description. For the GTD fans, this is synonymous with my 30,000 Horizon of Focus. Here’s what it looks like:</p>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-medium" src="/assets/posts_extra/MonthlyPlanning_MonthlyPlan.jpg" /></p>

<p>I have multiple goals per month. I put the name of the month in the title of the task so I can keep them in order, and that’s all it takes for me to stay on track. When I see this list, I know what’s coming up and I can plan my days and weeks appropriately.</p>

<h2 id="working-the-plan">Working The Plan</h2>

<p>A plan is worthless if it isn’t reviewed, so I read each line item once a week and let that dictate what I work on each day. I make sure that I’m on track and that the direction I’ve chosen is still accurate. I don’t get bent out of shape when I change the plan for the next four months; I’m being realistic with myself.</p>

<p>When I’m finished looking over the Monthly Plan, I translate it into a plan for the upcoming week - my Weekly Plan. The Weekly Plan is a simple two or three item list of the things I need to complete next week in order to make progress on the Monthly Plan. It breaks it down into pieces I can digest that week.</p>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-medium" src="/assets/posts_extra/MonthlyPlanning_WeeklyPlan.jpg" /></p>

<h2 id="overkill">Overkill</h2>

<p>I’m terrible at remembering, that’s why I need these systems. This sounds like a lot of work even for me, but here’s the point: 12 months is too far out, and I need guidance. I use this month by month plan to help me decide what to work on each day. It’s a single, uncluttered list that is easily reviewed and updated. I don’t want complicated. I want it to keep my head on straight and help me hit my goals. If it does that, it’s a success.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/TextExpander-Snippet-Nomenclature.jpg" /><p>I currently have 217 snippets in TextExpander. That’s likely not a big number for some people, but for my forgetful mind it’s a lot. To keep them straight, I use a simple nomenclature for my snippet abbreviations.
<!--more--></p>

<p>The general premise is to use a short group indicator followed by a more specific identifier. It’s kind of like tagging. I still use groups in TextExpander to keep them clean, but this helps me remember them.</p>

<h2 id="links">Links</h2>

<p>There are some URLs that I type a lot. I use the links to <a href="https://tools.joebuhlig.com/working-with-omnifocus/"><em>Working with OmniFocus</em></a>, <a href="https://github.com/joebuhlig/OFScripts">OFScripts</a>, this website, and my email accounts (Gmail) daily, so I added them to TextExpander. I use the group indicator <code class="highlighter-rouge">link</code> and an identifier like <code class="highlighter-rouge">wwo</code> to help me remember them. So I would type <code class="highlighter-rouge">link.wwo</code> to get <code class="highlighter-rouge">https://tools.joebuhlig.com/working-with-omnifocus/</code>.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">link.home = http://joebuhlig.com

link.tools = https://tools.joebuhlig.com

link.pod = http://joebuhlig.com/whaddyaknowjoe/

link.wwo = https://tools.joebuhlig.com/working-with-omnifocus/

link.ofscripts = https://github.com/joebuhlig/OFScripts</code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="markdown">Markdown</h2>

<p>All of my writing is done in <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">markdown</a> because I can get it into HTML so easily. It’s only natural that I have a few snippets to make this even easier. To help me remember them, I use the group indicator <code class="highlighter-rouge">md</code>.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">*This one uses two snippets that I'll mention later*
md.curtab = [%snippet:xcurtitle%](%snippet:xcurlink%)

md.image = ![%|](/assets/posts_extra/)

md.reddit = [Discuss this on Reddit.](%filltext:name=Insert link to Reddit discussion%)</code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="yaml">YAML</h2>

<p>A couple months ago I moved from WordPress to a <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/from-wordpress-google-to-jekyll-piwik/">static site with Jekyll</a>. Part of the Jekyll environment involves “Front Matter” which is comprised of <a href="http://yaml.org/">YAML</a>. Every time I create a new article or podcast, I add this to the top of the markdown file. In my scenario, I also need to create the slug for the article. I’ve create the following snippets with the group indicator <code class="highlighter-rouge">yaml</code>.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">*For the slug, you first need to copy the text to be slugified.*
*I usually just copy the title of the article.*

yaml.slug = Javascript Snippet

var text = TextExpander.pasteboardText;
text = text.replace(/[^\w\s]/gi, '');
var newtext = text.split(" ").join("-");
TextExpander.appendOutput("/" + newtext.toLowerCase() + "/");</code></pre></figure>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">yaml.blog =

<h2 id="code">Code</h2>

<p>I write a lot of code. I build my own websites and do freelance development. I use a number of languages, so I’ve created group indicators for each language: <code class="highlighter-rouge">html</code> for HTML, <code class="highlighter-rouge">css</code> for CSS, <code class="highlighter-rouge">rb</code> for Ruby, <code class="highlighter-rouge">py</code> for Python, and so on. And because HTML can get to be big, I broke it into groupings for individual tags as well.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">a.n = &lt;a href=""&gt;%|&lt;/a&gt;

p.n = &lt;p&gt;%|&lt;/p&gt;

p.class = &lt;p class=""&gt;%|&lt;/p&gt;

div.n = &lt;div&gt;%|&lt;/div&gt;

html.base = &lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;%|&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;

html.clear = &lt;div class="clear"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

html.img = &lt;img src="%|" /&gt;</code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="ip-addresses">IP Addresses</h2>

<p>Along with coding, I have a number of IP addresses to keep track of. I don’t like referencing a table somewhere or even looking them up in 1Password. I prefer to create shortcuts to them with <code class="highlighter-rouge">ip</code> as the indicator.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">ip.jb = XX.XX.XX.XX

ip.tools = XX.XX.XX.XX

ip.clientname = XX.XX.XX.XX

*You didn't think I'd actually share them, did you?*</code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="catchallscripts">Catchall/Scripts</h2>

<p>There are a lot of cases when I just want something short and it doesn’t have to be grouped because I use them so much. Formatted dates are great and so are a few scripts I run frequently. I simply use <code class="highlighter-rouge">x</code> at the start of the snippet.</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">*Today's date in the format of YYYYMMDD*
xtd = 20151211

*Next Monday's date in the format of YYYYMMDD. I have one for each day of the week.*
xnm = 20151214</code></pre></figure>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">*The title of the current page in Safari*
xcurtitle = Applescript

tell application "Safari"
    set theName to name of front document
    return theName
end tell</code></pre></figure>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">*The URL of the current page in Safari. It removes any querystrings as well.*
xcurlink = Applescript

tell application "Safari"
    set theName to name of front document
    set theURL to URL of front document
    set oldDelimiters to AppleScript's text item delimiters
    set AppleScript's text item delimiters to "?"
    set theArray to every text item of theURL
    set AppleScript's text item delimiters to oldDelimiters
    set theURL to item 1 of theArray
    return theURL
end tell</code></pre></figure>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">xplan = Plan project for 

xwait = Waiting for 

xas = AppleScript

xgh = GitHub

xof = OmniFocus</code></pre></figure>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/Keeping-Up-with-Ideas.jpg" /><p>Ideas are sometimes hard to come up with. But what happens when you have so many that you get lost? You have all these ideas begging you for attention and it becomes unclear which ones you should take on and which ones you should let go.
<!--more--></p>

<p>I don’t know how to tackle this issue with anything other than a list. But a list is no good if you don’t trust it. You have to trust that you’ll add items to it and you have to trust that you’ll come back to it. There may be mental freedom in writing it down, but if you never look at it again you’ve just conned yourself into forgetting.</p>

<h2 id="analog-vs-digital">Analog vs Digital</h2>

<p>Where you keep this list doesn’t matter, as long as it works for you. Most people assume that I do everything digitally. False. Many times I’m writing notes or drawing pictures on a <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/what-is-an-hpda-and-how-do-i-use-it/">note card</a>. I convert it later, but I still prefer pen and paper.</p>

<p>Choose the process that works for you. If you’re using a paper calendar, you’ll likely want to keep this list on paper as well. If you don’t have a printer, you’ll probably find an app for it.</p>

<h2 id="capture">Capture</h2>

<p>No matter which form of list keeping you use, it’s imperative that you keep something around to <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/getting-things-done-capture/">grab these ideas</a> when they come. And they <em>will</em> hit you at inopportune times. Think about how you’ll capture ideas when you’re driving your car or taking a shower. If you don’t have a plan, you’ll start losing them.</p>

<h2 id="building-trust">Building Trust</h2>

<p>The only way you’ll build trust in your new list is to read through it regularly. I’ve found weekly to be a great starting point. It doesn’t matter when, so long as you do it. Schedule a time if you have to, but make sure you don’t forget this step; it is the most vital part of the process.</p>

<p>With consistent review, you begin to trust that your ideas aren’t lost after you write them down. You will come back to them. And as a nice bonus, you’ll start to have more ideas as you go through the list. Seeing them all together typically prompts new ones to form.</p>

<h2 id="making-decisions">Making Decisions</h2>

<p>If you create this list, collect ideas for it, and trust it, it’s still worthless if you never activate an idea. But when do you start working on an idea and how do you know which one to pick?</p>

<p>Timing is the easy part. You can only choose to work on an idea if you have time (or make time) for it. If you decide to <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/why-getting-up-early/">get up early</a> to work on that new side project, you know when you’ll work on it. If you feel overwhelmed by your workload as it is, you need to focus on completing current projects before you take on a new one.</p>

<p>Deciding which idea to pursue is the hard part. If possible, you want the idea to have purpose and hold your interest. If there’s no strategic or direct value in it, why work on it? It should either be a building block to something else or a straightforward product that you’ll enjoy.</p>

<p>When you find yourself having a lot of new ideas, take advantage of it. Write them down, because they don’t always come when you want them.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/Generating-Creative-Energy.jpg" /><p>I had never thought of myself as a creative person until recently. Math and science have always been my strengths, so the arty side never took center stage.
<!--more--></p>

<p>Then I started this blog. People say that one benefit of writing is a better understanding of your own thoughts. It’s true. I’ve learned a lot about myself since starting to blog, and it’s one of the primary reasons I recommend blogging to others.</p>

<p>But writing on a schedule or regularly creating anything requires a lot of new ideas. When you start, you may have a backlog of these that you’ve been thinking about. But at some point you’ll need more. How do you plan to generate them?</p>

<p>Do a quick search for “releasing creative energy” and you’ll find a lot of articles on how to develop more ideas - going on a walk, meditating, getting outside, drinking coffee, people watching, and so on.</p>

<p>These are great tips to help clear your mind and allow you to find and connect new dots. But I’ve found that there’s more to it than <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/13/">letting my mind wander</a>. Sometimes I need to take action to kick off creativity flow.</p>

<h2 id="check-things-off">Check Things Off</h2>

<p>Think about the most recent big project you completed. What did you do after it was checked off? Celebrate? Take a week off? Lie low for a while?</p>

<p>And how did you feel when it was done? After a big push like I did for <em><a href="https://tools.joebuhlig.com/working-with-omnifocus/">Working with OmniFocus</a></em>, I felt a huge weight lift and I started wondering what would come next. I had been working so hard for so long that not having that big project in front of me gave me a sense of freedom and excitement. It released my mind to go on to the next thing, which kicked off creative flow.</p>

<h2 id="analog-brainstorming">Analog Brainstorming</h2>

<p>There’s something about leaving ink on a piece of paper that helps my mind process thoughts more clearly. The process of analog writing is so natural that I can move from one idea to the other with very little friction. Even hitting a keyboard shortcut to add a node to a mindmap can create enough resistance to slow my wandering brain and interfere with the next idea. I have two things to think about - the idea itself and the process of entering that idea. (Talk about high maintenance.)</p>

<p>Between paper and whiteboards, I’m free to roam from one topic or crazy idea to another with zero resistance to connecting the next dot. Writing by hand is natural; when I need an idea for something, I go analog and let my mind meander.</p>

<p>Note: a timer is helpful here. It can eliminate the worry of spending too much time daydreaming.</p>

<h2 id="talk-about-it">Talk About It</h2>

<p>I often forget this step or don’t want to do it, but telling friends about your ideas can spark more ideas. A different perspective on a topic can lead to more connections, developing your idea into something more complete.</p>

<p>I don’t like to do this. What if someone steals my idea? I don’t want something I’ve come up with being taken from me. But I’ve found that rarely happens. If I stick to my trusted circle of mentors and friendships, it’s not an issue.</p>

<h2 id="collect">Collect</h2>

<p>The more inputs and experiences you can bring into your mind, the more points you have to connect. This is partly why going for a walk, getting outside, and watching people can drive new ideas. These experiences provoke your mind to roam and give you new information to connect to your previous ideas and thoughts.</p>

<p>The more information you can collect about your topic and the more experiences you have, the more ingredients you have to formulate and expand your idea.</p>

<p>My goal in all of these scenarios is to <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/getting-things-done-introduction/">free my mind</a> to have ideas. If I’m able to think clearly without worry, I can create more freely.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/Breaking-the-Cycle.jpg" /><p>It’s time for a confession: I’m addicted to my phone. I want to check Twitter every five minutes and find myself refreshing Feedly every ten. And I hate it.
<!--more--></p>

<p>I’ve developed a habit of always wondering if there is something that needs my response. If someone asks me a question on Twitter, I want to get back to them right away. I don’t want them waiting on me. I don’t like being the one that holds up the line.</p>

<h2 id="steps-to-building-a-habit">Steps to building a habit</h2>

<p>There’s a lot of research behind building habits, but it doesn’t have to apply only to good habits. Understanding this cycle can help break bad habits as well. Break one of the steps and the habit stops.</p>

<h3 id="1-trigger">1. Trigger</h3>

<p>I love helping. Finding ways to solve problems for others will motivate me to work all day, every day. The downside is that I will sometimes go looking for problems that need to be solved. I primarily look for these problems in my own systems and tools, so the trigger is simply wondering if someone found an issue or has a question.</p>

<h3 id="2-reaction">2. Reaction</h3>

<p>My reaction to this trigger is to solve the problem or look for a problem. Whenever I wonder if there is a problem that needs solved or I think that a question might have popped up, I check the various places where a problem or question could arise. In my case, that’s mostly Twitter, Reddit, or email.</p>

<h3 id="3-treat">3. Treat</h3>

<p>Much like our dog gets treats when he does a trick, I get a treat when I solve a problem or answer a question. People tend to say thank you or show appreciation when you help out and that small incentive makes me want to keep helping. The trigger has been set off again.</p>

<h2 id="breaking-the-cycle">Breaking the cycle</h2>

<p>Scientists in agriculture have become really good at breaking the life cycle of insects. Whether it’s interrupting their mating season, creating a bad environment for eggs, or not allowing one of the metamorphosis steps, they can find ways to keep the pests from propagating and damaging crops.</p>

<p>It’s this cycle interruption that I’m attempting to put in place. Just telling myself not to  wonder will not likely happen. The thought enters faster than I can stop it, so I need to stop my reaction to the trigger - looking at social media and email. My primary means of checking is my phone and the best way to keep me off my phone is to leave it out of my reach. I’m much too lazy to get up just to check Twitter.</p>

<p>While I’m at work I can keep my phone across the room since I don’t usually check things on my Mac. I can leave it in my office when I go upstairs for lunch. After work, I have designated a place for it to land. If it’s not in my pocket, I’m less likely to get it and check things.</p>

<p>My hope is that by breaking this cycle, I’ll be more present with my family and break the habit. I know that my attention has fallen away from them when they need it. I’m not okay with that.</p>

<p>Tim Stringer, founder of Learn OmniFocus, recently invited me to do a live webinar about my OmniFocus setup on the site and add to this growing repository of content. I was thrilled and  honored to share.</p>

<p>In the recording below you’ll see normal stuff like setting up projects and contexts, but I also emphasize the importance of doing regular reviews and share a script I’ve written to help. I like doing reviews on set days, so I needed to be able to move the Next Review Date of a project to match my scheduled review date. If you’re interested in this script or some of the others I mention in the webinar, you can <a href="https://github.com/joebuhlig/OFScripts">find them on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>Outside of <a href="https://tools.joebuhlig.com/working-with-omnifocus/">Working with Omnifocus</a>, this is one of the most complete overviews of my entire system. Tim Stringer has generously given me the feed to share with you, so check it out.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/Take-a-break.jpg" /><p>Numerous times I’ve said that being able to put off work is an important step of being productive. And when you have a big push, it’s even more important to stop.
<!--more--></p>

<p>I’ve been working long hours for the last couple months to make <a href="https://tools.joebuhlig.com/working-with-omnifocus/"><em>Working with OmniFocus</em></a> happen. There were late nights, early mornings, and long afternoons. Blood, sweat, tears, sickness and exhaustion all came into play at some point. And I’ve been thrilled at the response.</p>

<p>Many of you have sent me emails and joined the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/joebuhlig/comments/3rhedi/working_with_omnifocus/">Reddit discussion</a> to let me know what you think of the book. I have received emails from folks who have changed their perspective on how they work and look for better ways to manage their tasks. They are heartfelt and grateful. They drive me to do more and help anywhere I can. It’s these people that keep me excited about the work I do.</p>

<p>And I will continue to look for ways to do that, but not right now. After the hard work that’s gone into this and the unending support that my family has given me over the past months, it’s time to take a short break and give to them. I’ll be back at it next week, but I’m taking a long weekend to recoup.  Thank you for all the great feedback, it’s been a wild ride.</p>

<p>##<a href="http://tools.joebuhlig.com/working-with-omnifocus/">Get Working with OmniFocus</a></p>

<p>It’s been down to the wire, but it’s finally here - <em>Working with OmniFocus</em>. A book that takes you through my entire system. It’s not for someone looking for a how-to manual for OmniFocus, but for those looking to understand the deeper concepts and nuances of the tool.</p>

<p>I’m super excited that it’s finally here! I’ve spent most of my editing time trying to make sure that it’s packed full of details and examples. The more real I can be with you, the better you can understand how it works.</p>

<p>##<a href="http://tools.joebuhlig.com/affiliates/">Affiliate Sign Up</a></p>

<p>If you’ve read the book and want to share it with others, why not make money while you’re at it? You can <a href="http://tools.joebuhlig.com/affiliates/">sign up</a> to be an affiliate and get paid when others make a purchase using your link.</p>

<p>##<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/joebuhlig/comments/3rhedi/working_with_omnifocus/">Discuss the Book</a></p>

<p>I made a consolidated place for us to chat about the book. Most of the time that discussion is more helpful in public. And the quickest, easiest way I know to do that is with Reddit. I have a Subreddit (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/joebuhlig/">/r/joebuhlig</a>) where I’ve posted the link to the book.

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/Favorite-Workflows.jpg" /><p>I’ve received a number of requests for more detail around my use of <a href="https://workflow.is/">Workflow</a> (<a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/workflow-powerful-automation/id915249334?mt=8&amp;at=1l3vnyQ">iTunes</a>). I’ve said that it saves time, but here are some details.
<!--more--></p>

<p>If I find myself doing something repeatedly, I look for a way to automate it. Since AppleScripting isn’t possible on iOS, I turn to Workflow for some of the same functionality. Here are my heavy hitter workflows.</p>

<h2 id="headed-home">Headed Home</h2>

<p><a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/efa5488ee8e44687ad75e628a5ba1b1d">Headed Home Workflow</a></p>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-small" src="/assets/posts_extra/Workflow_Headed-Home.png" /></p>

<p>There a quite a few instances each week when I’m out of the house without a specific time that I’m expected to return. My wife often needs to know when I’m headed home so she can plan accordingly. In those cases, I use this workflow to let her know I’m on my way and how long it should be before I get there. This workflow is one of three that I keep in the Today View for easy access because I use it so frequently.</p>

<h2 id="copy-base-url">Copy Base URL</h2>

<p><a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/1de51ad711624c1daace1159e2abab4e">Copy Base URL Workflow</a></p>

<p>This is a rare case when I introduce more steps to a process in order to get a cleaner result. Many times I need to copy a URL but I really don’t like having extra querystring parameters at the end of the URL. I use this to expand shortened URLS and strip the extra nonsense off the end. Then it’s added to my clipboard.</p>

<h2 id="save-to-dropbox">Save to DropBox</h2>

<p><a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/db653ceda86942328b802cce58f6b6ed">Save to DropBox Workflow</a></p>

<p>Any time I run across a file (typically a PDF) on my phone that I want to save to DropBox, I use this. I could do the “Open in…” thing, but I know where I want it to go in DropBox before I even start - my DropBox inbox. This workflow takes the file and drops it into my inbox. It’s faster than everything else I’ve tried.</p>

<h2 id="share-title--twitter">Share Title &amp; Twitter</h2>

<p><a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/44904f69761047ae8fb3d8a741ff08d6">Share Title &amp; Twitter Workflow</a></p>

<p>I have another <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/workflow-to-share-articles-with-twitter-handle/">one similar to this</a> that shares an article with a Twitter handle and asks for a comment about the article. If I don’t have a specific thought about an article but still want to share it, I use this instead. It puts the title of the article in quotes, adds a link to the article, and searches the page for a Twitter handle to include at the end of the tweet.</p>

<h2 id="instatweet">InstaTweet</h2>

<p><a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/7702a22e5dfe426da5a60f59d519ba10">InstaTweet Workflow</a></p>

<p>When I want to share a photo on Instagram and Twitter I know I can select Twitter from Instagram, but I prefer to embed them directly. This workflow allows me to select the photo, add a caption, and send it both places at once.</p>

<h2 id="article-to-pdf">Article to PDF</h2>

<p><a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/2ec2ca89dbad4c4db754788f6fccae9d">Article to PDF Workflow</a></p>

<p>This is a small piece of my research storage mechanism. To save an article  for a project I’m working on, I run this workflow which saves it as a PDF in my DropBox inbox. These are processed during my <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/gaining-perspective-daily-review/">Daily Review</a> and are often moved to project folders.</p>

<h2 id="take-pic-to-dropbox">Take Pic to DropBox</h2>

<p><a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/c348878f30b24163afc1d4cbdce15b87">Take Pic to DropBox Workflow</a></p>

<p>This is similar to the Article to PDF workflow, but it opens the camera. I take a picture and it is immediately sent to my DropBox inbox. This is really handy if I want to save a picture of a restaurant menu or a bag of coffee. When I process these, I move them to their respective locations in my file structure for reference.</p>

<h2 id="send-pic-to-dropbox">Send Pic to DropBox</h2>

<p><a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/ec13b1062c5d47a1813a348ed659c27c">Send Pic to DropBox Workflow</a></p>

<p>Just like the previous workflow, this adds a picture to my DropBox inbox but allows me to select pictures from my photo library. There are times when I remember taking a picture that I want to use for a project. This helps me get them into DropBox quickly and easily.</p>

<h2 id="screenshot-to-dropbox">Screenshot to DropBox</h2>

<p><a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/43d066eb6d194620b1ed4f9134d96810">Screenshot to DropBox Workflow</a></p>

<p>I’m building a lot of websites lately and part of my process involves looking for web design inspiration. This means I’m taking a lot of screenshots of other websites. I keep this workflow in my Today View so I can take the screenshot, swipe down, and send it to DropBox right away.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/Stop-Being-Productive.jpg" /><p>There are a lot of productivity bloggers and podcasters out there. And we’re all looking for ways to get better, faster, and create higher quality products. That’s pretty obvious when you read our articles.
<!--more--></p>

<p>But if you were able to see my side of the screen you would see my daily fight to be productive. I want to waste a day on YouTube every day. I could do that. I would hate myself for it, but I want to do it anyway. It’s a struggle that I think we all fight at some level.</p>

<p>I review my weekly goals every morning. That’s what matters to me. I want to get my work done so I can spend more time with my family. And I want to spend time on projects that I find important. That single step is easily the most vital component to a productive day for me.</p>

<p>I can do that routine day after day and I <em>will</em> do it day after day. It’s the only way I have a chance of accomplishing anything. And if I’m honest and open with you, I would admit that there are many days I fail.</p>

<p>I have days when I’m doing good to get through my email. I have no idea why, but I  really don’t want to do anything that’s on my lists. I have deadlines coming but I’m doing research for a project that I won’t even consider starting for another year. I’m great at procrastiworking.</p>

<h1 id="but-stop">But stop</h1>

<p>Here’s the thing. We can all find ways to do work in <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/lost-in-transition/">transitional times</a> and maximize every minute of every day in our calendars. But, I’m tired. I just want to blow some time on Twitter. Is that okay?</p>

<p><em>I think that’s perfectly fine</em>. I do it. I don’t recommend doing it a lot and I try to limit the amount of time I blow, but I think it’s important to stop being productive once in a while. Or maybe it’s best to stop being productive multiple times a week or day. It just depends on what you’ve been doing, how tired you are, and how much you have coming up.</p>

<p>I’ve been working really long hours trying to get <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/omnifocus/">my book</a> finished. It’s tiring and at the end of each day I struggle to think straight. When the girls go down for bed I blow a little time reading articles or cruising Twitter-land. I’m unable to do any work at that time. I don’t even want to look at my lists. I just need to stop.</p>

<h1 id="and-do-what">And do what?</h1>

<p>When you stop, don’t always blow it on YouTube. The number one way I stop is by playing with my girls. They need me more than I need to catch up on Instagram. I try to stop for a while after work every day. I don’t check my lists and I do my best to set my phone down. I’ve been on the computer all day and I have a cycle of catching up on inboxes every 30 minutes or so. When I’ve done that all day my brain expects me to continue feeding it with new things whether I’m working or not. It doesn’t care that I need a break.</p>

<p>But I do care. I don’t want to continue feeding that addiction. It’s hard, but sometimes it’s best to just stop being productive.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/From-Wordpress-Google-to-Jekyll-Piwik.jpg" /><p>This website has run on WordPress and Google Analytics from day one and they’ve both treated me pretty well. But I’ve started to see a need for more flexibility in the site, so it’s time for a big change.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>This is mostly a back-end change that shouldn’t affect the UI much. There are a few small UI changes I’m making, but that’s to make the site cleaner. The more I’ve gotten into web development and design the pickier I’ve become with my site. Ultimately, I’m looking for a simplified user experience for you and more respect for your privacy.</p>

<h2 id="why-wordpress-and-google">Why WordPress and Google?</h2>

<p>For about a year and a half I ran the site on <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> through <a href="http://www.bluehost.com/">Bluehost</a> with Google Analytics.  It was easy and quick for me at the time. WordPress has a good, long track record so I fell in line to get my site up quickly. I didn’t want to worry about technicalities - I needed to spend my time creating.</p>

<p>The standard for analytics has been Google Analytics for some time. Google has a reputation for having some of the best if not <em>the</em> best reports and tracking for your website. When I started I knew very little about tracking. I was just looking for a way to see what kind of traffic I was getting and almost everyone recommended GA. Sometimes I’m okay with taking the easy road if it means shipping something quickly. I can evaluate the nuances later. And I can always do the research and migration process after the launch if I need to - which is what I’ve done here.</p>

<h2 id="why-jekyll">Why Jekyll?</h2>

<p>As a replacement for WordPress, I’ve decided to create a static site using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. I ran across Jekyll through blog posts from <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/">Brett Terpstra</a>. I then spent a couple of hours researching and reviewing websites built with Jekyll. I was blown away by the load speeds involved.</p>

<p>I started looking at some of the numbers on my site and found that the average page was loading in about eight seconds. All of the tests I was doing on my machine came in around four seconds, but that didn’t take into account the various devices that people use. That extra four seconds meant my site was way too slow. <em>Eight seconds?</em> Sites built with Jekyll are typically loading in less than one second.</p>

<p>I’ve been wanting to get into Ruby and Rails lately. Since Jekyll is built on Ruby and I <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/7/">learn by using a language</a>, it made for a good project. Jekyll seems to be one of the most common static site generators as well. There’s a lot of support and plugins for it already, so I felt comfortable joining that community.</p>

<p>Moving to a static site allows me the flexibility to build one-off pages and posts in a highly customized way. Since I’m becoming more particular about how things look and how you interact with them, it only makes sense. Jekyll seems to fit the bill quite well.</p>

<h2 id="why-piwik">Why Piwik?</h2>

<p>I want to step away from the data collection that Google does on you. I don’t want to share your data against your will and I don’t want to put you into their system simply because you wanted to read my articles. I understand that you might be okay with this, but I’m learning that I’m not necessarily okay with this myself. There’s a big backlash against ads and tracking right now and although I’m not wanting to jump on that bandwagon, it is something that I’ve been thinking a lot about lately.</p>

<p>And although tracking and ads are okay in some scenarios, I’ve found that I’m uneasy about the tracking that goes alongside Google Analytics. That might be unwarranted and unfounded, but I don’t want to leave it when it makes me uncomfortable. A great example of this is <a href="http://www.marco.org/">Marco Arment</a> and his ad-blocking iOS app. He had a great app and it worked well, but it <a href="http://www.marco.org/2015/09/18/just-doesnt-feel-good">didn’t feel right</a> for him. So he pulled it and Apple issued refunds. Google Analytics on this website falls in the same category for me. It might be okay, but I’m not comfortable with it.</p>

<p>I still have a need to understand the analytics for my site so I started looking for alternatives and ran across <a href="http://piwik.org/">Piwik</a>. It allows me to collect the numbers that I’m looking for, but the data stays local. There is no master server that the numbers go back to. Your data never leaves the site. I have a database (that only I have access to) that stores the information and it sits on the same server that this website sits on. The data is anonymous and never goes anywhere. It allows me to get those numbers and not sacrifice your privacy in the process. I think that’s a great trade-off.</p>

<h2 id="hosting">Hosting?</h2>

<p>In the process of making the shift to a static site, I’m also launching a <a href="http://tools.joebuhlig.com/">new sub-domain</a> that will be running on Rails. I was previously running my hosting through Bluehost, but while setting up a Rails application, I found that Bluehost is not very easy to use for anything other than one-click installations. So I’m also moving my host over to <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a> (<a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=b0f9f06b6067">affiliate</a>).</p>

<h2 id="when">When?</h2>

<p>Today. I spent the last few weeks working on the static site. There are still some bugs I’m working out, but for the most part it’s all here. Let me know what you think!</p>

The funny thing is that my tech-resistant wife is now dependent on it as well. And you can be sure that I am pretty excited about <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/5/">her use of it</a>.</p>

<p>Drafts can be intimidating if you’re not used to dreaming up ways to connect apps on your phone. So it’s helpful to use other people’s ideas as a baseline for building your own methods. Here are a some of my favorite ways to use Drafts:</p>

<h2 id="omnifocus-with-note">OmniFocus with note</h2>

<p><a href="x-drafts4://x-callback-url/import_action?v=2&amp;tintColor=%5B%0A%20%200.451%2C%0A%20%200.29%2C%0A%20%200.553%0A%5D&amp;shouldConfirm=0&amp;logLevel=1&amp;uuid=BDE52DB2-95AF-4AD4-8734-17068C3E8C9F&amp;disposition=2&amp;actionSteps=%5B%0A%20%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%22urlTemplate%22%20%3A%20%22omnifocus%3A%5C%2F%5C%2F%5C%2Fadd%3Fname%3D%7B%7B%5B%5Btitle%5D%5D%7D%7D%26note%3D%7B%7B%5B%5Bbody%5D%5D%7D%7D%22%2C%0A%20%20%20%20%22encodeTags%22%20%3A%20false%2C%0A%20%20%20%20%22actionStepType%22%20%3A%20%22URL%22%0A%20%20%7D%0A%5D&amp;description=First%20line%20saves%20to%20the%20title%20of%20a%20OmniFocus%20task%2C%20while%20the%20rest%20of%20the%20Draft%20is%20added%20to%20Notes%20section.%20The%20original%20draft%20is%20then%20archived%20automatically.%20&amp;modifiedAt=2015-07-20%2012%3A13%3A49%20%2B0000&amp;name=OmniFocus%20with%20Note&amp;iconImageName=action_clipboard">Install OmniFocus with Note Drafts Action</a></p>

<p>My primary use of Drafts is to capture tasks that will end up in OmniFocus. It’s not uncommon to see the Drafts badge at six or higher. Those are typically tasks that will be moved to OmniFocus but I needed to capture them quickly.</p>

<h2 id="save-url-as-pdf-in-dropbox">Save URL as PDF in DropBox</h2>

<p><a href="x-drafts4://x-callback-url/import_action?v=2&amp;tintColor=%5B%0A%0A%5D&amp;shouldConfirm=0&amp;logLevel=1&amp;uuid=D65D2C58-A84A-4517-8015-1BE97D43C6B5&amp;disposition=2&amp;actionSteps=%5B%0A%20%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%22writeType%22%20%3A%20%22create%22%2C%0A%20%20%20%20%22fileTemplate%22%20%3A%20%22%5B%5Bbody%5D%5D%22%2C%0A%20%20%20%20%22actionStepType%22%20%3A%20%22Dropbox%22%2C%0A%20%20%20%20%22folderTemplate%22%20%3A%20%22%5C%2FArticle_Import%22%2C%0A%20%20%20%20%22fileExtTemplate%22%20%3A%20%22txt%22%2C%0A%20%20%20%20%22fileNameTemplate%22%20%3A%20%22%5B%5Btitle%5D%5D%22%0A%20%20%7D%0A%5D&amp;description=&amp;modifiedAt=2015-09-28%2012%3A02%3A35%20%2B0000&amp;name=Save%20URL%20as%20PDF&amp;iconImageName=action_dropbox">Install Save URL as PDF Drafts Action</a></p>

<p>When I run across an article I’m interested in but I’m not sure what I want to do with it I’ll dump it into Drafts. When I’m emptying my Drafts inbox during my <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/gaining-perspective-daily-review/">Daily Review</a> and run across one of these that I want to save as research, I use this action. It creates a text file in DropBox with the title of the article as the title of the file and puts the URL in the body of the file. My Mac will then turn that text file into a PDF that I can use for later.</p>

<h2 id="omnifocus-list">OmniFocus list</h2>

<p><a href="x-drafts4://x-callback-url/import_action?v=2&amp;tintColor=%5B%0A%20%200.451%2C%0A%20%200.29%2C%0A%20%200.553%0A%5D&amp;shouldConfirm=0&amp;logLevel=1&amp;uuid=9B95D317-17CC-4336-809D-2410C52B7AF2&amp;disposition=2&amp;actionSteps=%5B%0A%20%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%22listName%22%20%3A%20%22Omnifocus%22%2C%0A%20%20%20%20%22noteDelimiter%22%20%3A%20%22%7C%22%2C%0A%20%20%20%20%22actionStepType%22%20%3A%20%22List%20in%20Reminders%22%0A%20%20%7D%0A%5D&amp;description=&amp;modifiedAt=2015-09-28%2015%3A57%3A57%20%2B0000&amp;name=OmniFocus&amp;iconImageName=action_reminder">Install OmniFocus List Drafts Action</a></p>

<p>Close behind the <em>OmniFocus with Note</em> action is the <em>OmniFocus List</em> action. It works pretty much the same way as the first except I can brain-dump a list of items all at once. Each line in the draft will become a new task in OmniFocus.</p>

<h2 id="today-extension">Today extension</h2>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-small" src="/assets/posts_extra/Drafts_Today_Clip.png" /></p>

<p>If I run across a quote that I want to embed in a blog post or share with someone, I can copy it and send it Drafts with the “+clip” action in the Today View. It lands in my Drafts inbox for triage later, but sometimes I go and action it right then.</p>

<h2 id="omnifocus-action-key">OmniFocus action key</h2>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-small" src="/assets/posts_extra/OmniFocus_Keyboard_Action.png" /></p>

<p>If I want to be really quick and send ideas to OmniFocus immediately, I can invoke the action key. It sits right on top of the keyboard so as soon as I’m done typing I can hit that to send it to OmniFocus immediately and start typing the next task without any delay. This one feature has me using Drafts for brainstorming sessions.</p>

<h2 id="siri-to-drafts">Siri to Drafts</h2>

<p>I have my default reminders list set to a list called “Drafts.” Drafts is set up to pull items from this list into my Drafts inbox. This allows me to ask Siri to remind me of something and it will automatically end up in my Drafts inbox.</p>

<h2 id="omnifocus-somedaymaybes">OmniFocus Someday/Maybes</h2>

<p>I’ve written about these in the past but I have a dedicated list of actions that take drafts and dump them into Someday/Maybe lists in OmniFocus without the need for any triage in my OmniFocus inbox. You can see how I <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/using-omnifocus-for-somedaymaybe-lists/">set up the actions here</a> and how I <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/omnifocus-auto-parser/">automatically parse them here</a>.</p>

<p>And because I’m proud of her getting into digital capture methods, here’s the one my wife uses all the time:</p>

<h2 id="email-yourself-a-task">Email yourself a task</h2>

<p><a href="x-drafts4://x-callback-url/import_action?v=2&amp;tintColor=%5B%0A%20%200.031%2C%0A%20%200.455%2C%0A%20%200.627%0A%5D&amp;shouldConfirm=0&amp;logLevel=2&amp;uuid=EA743F3F-8612-4615-88E4-6DAF1E0B344D&amp;disposition=2&amp;actionSteps=%5B%0A%20%20%7B%0A%20%20%20%20%22sendInBackground%22%20%3A%20true%2C%0A%20%20%20%20%22bccRecipientString%22%20%3A%20%22%22%2C%0A%20%20%20%20%22toRecipientString%22%20%3A%20%22example%40example.com%22%2C%0A%20%20%20%20%22subject%22%20%3A%20%22%5B%5Btitle%5D%5D%22%2C%0A%20%20%20%20%22replyTo%22%20%3A%20%22%22%2C%0A%20%20%20%20%22sendAsHTML%22%20%3A%20false%2C%0A%20%20%20%20%22sendInBackgroundPrefix%22%20%3A%20%22%22%2C%0A%20%20%20%20%22body%22%20%3A%20%22%5B%5Bbody%5D%5D%22%2C%0A%20%20%20%20%22actionStepType%22%20%3A%20%22Email%22%2C%0A%20%20%20%20%22ccRecipientString%22%20%3A%20%22%22%0A%20%20%7D%0A%5D&amp;description=Open%20Mail.app%20email%20window%20with%20first%20line%20of%20draft%20as%20subject%2C%20and%20the%20remainder%20of%20the%20draft%20as%20the%20body.&amp;modifiedAt=2015-10-08%2015%3A06%3A19%20%2B0000&amp;name=Email%20To%20Do&amp;iconImageName=action_email_filled">Install Email Yourself Drafts Action</a></p>

<p>Becky knows that having items sitting in her email inbox drives her crazy. She doesn’t like seeing new emails that she needs to act on. And she knows that if she emails a task to herself she will move it out of her inbox and into her paper system as soon as possible. Her email inbox is the one digital place that she checks regularly. So it’s nice for her to be able to email tasks to herself since she knows she’ll act on them. She uses drafts with an action key above her keyboard to type the task and immediately send it to her email. This would drive me insane, but it has been very helpful for her.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I use Drafts to get things out of my head. Anytime I see something online or I have an idea, I add it to Drafts first. Sometimes I can make the decision about what I want to do with it right then and will action it off immediately. But most of time I find myself leaving it in Drafts until my <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/gaining-perspective-daily-review/">Daily Review</a>. Drafts is my primary tool for keeping my head clear and my mind focused.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/How-I-Started-with-Technology.jpg" /><p>When I was 16 I bought my own Compaq laptop. Remember those? I had been using the family computer quite a bit, but this was my own computer. That was the beginning of my journey with technology.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="sound-and-slides">Sound and slides</h2>

<p>I claimed it would be for school work. That was my crap-rationalization. But if I’m honest with myself it had more to do with exploring without consequences. I didn’t want to screw up the family computer by running a bunch of batch files just to see what they would do. I would rather create a mess for myself on my own computer. That, and it was a lot of fun to say I own my own computer when I went to school.</p>

<p>Around the same time I started running sound and slides on Sunday morning at our church. If they wanted help with a special event when the sound system or a computer was involved, I nearly always said yes. I was drawn to it, fascinated by problem-solving with a bunch of cords and components working together.</p>

<h2 id="my-first-mac">My first Mac</h2>

<p>I bought my first Mac while at college. It was different and it seemed as though people who were building software and websites were using Macs. My thinking was purely, “That looks cool. I wanna try.” I don’t recommend making purchases of this size because something looks cool. But it was college, and I know there’s an unwritten requirement somewhere that says you should do something dumb in college.</p>

<p>The MacBook was my first jump into productivity, but I didn’t realize it. The Mac made it a lot easier for me to track events and notes. I always had a side-job in college and I needed help keeping track of my schedule. Looking back on it, I didn’t have a busy schedule. I just wanted to play with the apps. I guess my mind and digital tendencies naturally drew me to the building of systems that come with productivity.</p>

<h2 id="gis">GIS</h2>

<p>Also in college I did a couple of internships that had me working with GIS and handheld computers. They were set up to collect data on soil samples and crop scouting for corn and soybean fields, (yes, if you didn’t know, I’m a farm kid. No matter what I do or where I go, I’m always drawn to farmers and growing food. And tractors).</p>

<p>The fun part of those internships was finding ways of using handheld computers to make the process easier. I even began dictating notes into those devices. They were very crude at the time and I spent a lot of time cleaning up the notes I entered, but it was still a system that worked for me. It also taught me a lot about mapping and how to collect and report spatial data on crops.</p>

<h2 id="excel">Excel</h2>

<p>During my senior year of college I worked as a teaching assistant in a farm management class and began teaching other students how to use Excel. I was very basic in my use of Excel at the time, but I was more advanced than most of the students and professors. It was my first jump into teaching others how to use software. I was surprised that I actually enjoyed it. I’ve learned that my mind just works the same way computers do, which makes it very easy to catch on to a computer system and then translate it for others.</p>

<h2 id="databases-vba--sql">Databases, VBA, &amp; SQL</h2>

<p>When I graduated from college I went into soybean breeding and quickly learned that seed research works with a lot of data. And I also learned how to dissect tiny soybean flowers. My use of Excel grew exponentially and I found myself starting create basic programs through VBA and macros. It was a progression and eventually led me to using bar-code scanners and Excel macros to collect and verify data.</p>

<p>My experience in soybean breeding and the databases involved led me to a corporate position where I analyzed large amounts of data on a SQL Server. It was a very nerdy job and I didn’t really know what I was doing when I started. But I knew that I could learn just about anything computer-related pretty quickly, so I jumped in.</p>

<p>There was a lot of data to work with in that role. There were so many ways I <em>could</em> analyze the data that I often got lost trying to figure out what to work on. That’s when the productivity monster caught me and I started down the path of GTD.</p>

<h2 id="corporate-productivity-and-design">Corporate, productivity, and design</h2>

<p>In the corporate environment I had a big influx of information and creative work that I needed to do. Yes, I had a very analytical role but there’s a large amount of creativity that is needed to design and develop interfaces and structures around data. It was essentially the beginnings of web development for me because I wanted to show the data in an easy to understand way. I can’t stand looking at the same bar charts every day and wondering if the data has been altered to show a biased view of the information. I wanted them to be clean and accurate. That’s when my supervisor introduced me to <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/">Edward Tufte</a> and I began to delve into the data design world.</p>

<p>In that process I learned I have a strong creative side. I explored that more fully when I took a position with a marketing company. I started to develop more extensive web reports and began building an internal web application. That’s when I started to look beyond what I knew how to do and started building out new ideas and finding alternative ways to do things. In other words I finally let my brain loose and started learning how to pair my creative mind with the analytical.</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h2>

<p>If you listen to <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/whaddyaknowjoe/">my podcast</a> you heard me mention that I recently left my job and I’m now beginning to develop apps and web applications for myself and others. I’m now running with my own ideas and building them. I never thought I would be at this point, but it’s been an exciting journey.</p>

<p>Since starting on my own, I’ve been exploring new computer languages and building some of the bigger ideas that I never had time to tackle before. There’s some start-up time involved, but along this journey I have found systems and disciplines that help me stay motivated to focus on the work that I’m doing. Figuring out what technology to build next is exciting, and I’m having a blast.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/Sharing-a-Computer.jpg" /><p>When I switched to the MacBook Pro, I also switched from using two computers to one. I know, I know, I was spoiled. But it made my life a lot easier and helped me accomplish a lot more.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>One benefit of using two computers that I hadn’t noticed was the flexibility it gave my wife and me. When I used one computer, she could use the other. When the job-shift happened, it quickly became apparent that we were used to using them at the same time. I would grab the MacBook Air and she would do some work on the Mac Pro or vice versa.</p>

<p>Two computers was really convenient. However, I’m now building my own business, which means I’m tight on dollars spent. So I’m using a single computer for everything. And that has led to the need to coordinate work with my wife. I have writing and development to do and she has design and editing to do.</p>

<p>Here’s what we’ve learned on how to successfully share a computer:</p>

<h2 id="communicate">Communicate</h2>

<p>We have a daily conversation about time on the computer. I’m the one that spends the most time on it, but my wife has a few deadlines that she’s under as well. We need to make sure we’re talking about what’s needed, when it’s needed, and our plan for making it happen.</p>

<h2 id="multiple-users">Multiple users</h2>

<p>This almost goes without saying, but don’t share a user login on a shared computer. If my wife tries to do something on my profile, it will most likely do things she’s not expecting. If I use her profile, I’ll keep banging the keyboard wondering why it doesn’t launch the app I want. It just creates unnecessary angst. Get your own profile.</p>

<h2 id="external-hard-drive">External hard drive</h2>

<p>Unless you’ve upgraded the internal hard drive of your machine as much as you can, you’ll probably run into storage issues. The computer I’m on has a simple 128GB hard drive. That’s pretty small for having multiple users on it. So I have 4TB of Network Attached Storage (NAS) in the house. That allows us to connect to them over the wireless from anywhere in the house and keeps us from being unable to save files.</p>

<h2 id="grace">Grace</h2>

<p>Be gracious. It’s hard sharing something like a computer, especially when you need to get something done. It’s easy to get upset or frustrated with the other person. Show a little grace and be willing to compromise. It’ll make both of your lives a lot easier.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/Scheduled-Reviews-in-OmniFocus.jpg" /><p>Every Friday morning I do my <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/getting-things-done-reflect/">Weekly Review</a>. I do my Monthly Review on the first of the month and my Annual Review on the first of the year. How do I get OmniFocus to play nicely with this?</p>

<!--more-->

<p>OmniFocus has a great feature for reviewing projects at specific intervals. You can choose to review a project daily or every 50 years if you want. And when that date comes, the project is available in the Review perspective.</p>

<p>It’s a great feature. You can set the date of your Weekly Review as the next review date for a project and tell it to cycle every week. Then the project can be reviewed every week on that day.</p>

<h2 id="the-issue">The issue</h2>

<p>What happens if you do your review a day late? You’d be fine the first time since the project would just wait, but the next week would bring chaos. Your projects would cycle one week and would now be available for review the day after your scheduled review. They cycled by a week, but the day it uses as a base is the day it was reviewed, which was a day late.</p>

<p>If you throw multiple reviews in the mix (bi-weekly, monthly, annual, bi-annual), it can start to get out of hand very quickly. You’ll soon have a lot of projects that need to be reviewed, but they don’t show up in the Review perspective.</p>

<h2 id="the-solution">The solution</h2>

<p>I wanted a way to enter the day for my Weekly, Monthly, and Annual Reviews and have OmniFocus automatically reset the review dates on my projects to the next date each of these occurs.</p>

<p>In other words, if I have a project marked for review weekly (even if it’s every 3 weeks), I want the date for the next review to be the following Friday since that’s when I do my Weekly Review. If it’s marked for review monthly or yearly, I want the next date for my Monthly or Annual Review to be the next review date for those projects.</p>

<p>There’s not a way to do this directly in OmniFocus, so I wrote an AppleScript. You can find the <a href="https://github.com/joebuhlig/OFScripts">script on GitHub here</a>. I originally set this up with a launch agent like I did for the <a href="https://github.com/joebuhlig/OFScripts">OmniFocus Auto-Parser</a>, which you can <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/omnifocus-auto-parser/">learn more about here</a>. But I’ve since reworked this to be run on command directly from OmniFocus.</p>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>

<p>When you launch the script, it takes the next review date of the project and adjusts it forward to the next occurrence of the review. If the review cycle is weekly, the date is set to the next Weekly Review date. If the cycle is monthly or yearly, it is moved forward to the next date for each.</p>

<p>All I have to do is continue as normal and do my reviews on those days. If I see the indicator in OmniFocus before one of my scheduled reviews happens, I simply run the script.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/Writing-with-GitHub.jpg" /><p>I’ve written about my use of <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/my-writing-setup/">Sublime Text for writing</a>, but I didn’t share how I manage the edits from my editor.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I write everything in <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a>, which means the typical “track changes” tools don’t work very well in my workflow. I write the draft of an article, review and edit my own draft a couple times, and then send it to my editor. Since we do everything digitally, I needed a way to see what changes she has made as compared to my original.</p>

<p>The developer in me recognized the issue and immediately went to GitHub for versioning and merging updates. It has made the process really easy for me and for my editor. I don’t want her worrying about the delivery mechanism on top of all the editing. Here’s how I set it all up:</p>

<h2 id="the-setup"><a href="#the-setup"><span></span></a>The setup</h2>

<p>If you have experience with GitHub, this will all be second nature. If you don’t, I recommend looking at <a href="https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/">this article</a> to get a feel for the terminology and flow of Git.</p>

<p>I created a folder in DropBox to house all of my writing. This includes articles, <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/whaddyaknowjoe/">podcast</a> scripts, and even the <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/omnifocus/">book</a> I’m writing.</p>

<p>Using the GitHub desktop app, I created a new local repository on top of this folder. I’ve found myself using the app even though I know how to use Git from the command line. It’s simple and feels faster to me.</p>

<p>That’s all there was to do, create a new folder and turn it into a repository. I should mention that if you’re inviting someone as a collaborator in the repository, you should keep this outside of DropBox. It can create a lot of issues with syncing. GitHub even warns you about it. I can get away with it because I’m the only one involved and it’s a local repository. Keeping it on DropBox allows me to view and edit files from my iPhone, and I like having that option.</p>

<h2 id="1-drafting"><a href="#1-drafting"><span></span></a>1. Drafting</h2>

<p>I work off of the master branch in the repository and make all of my commits there. For example, I’ll write my first draft of an article and then commit it. I then review and edit that draft and commit my own edits.</p>

<p>To make the commits easy to track, I use a TextExpander snippet for the commit summary with this format:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Draftx_Articlex_YYYYMMDD</code></p>

<p>For the first part, I use one of these tags - Draftx, Editx, Reviewx, Managex. My first draft is under Draftx, my edits are Editx, my editor’s changes go under Reviewx, and any changes to the repository (adding/deleting/moving files) go under Managex. As an aside, here’s <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/simple-trick-naming-tags/">why I use the “x”</a> in those names.</p>

<p>The second portion of the commit summary is the type of writing I was doing - Articlex, Bookx, Podcastx, Websitex. Those are pretty self-explanatory.</p>

<h2 id="2-send-to-editor"><a href="#2-send-to-editor"><span></span></a>2. Send to editor</h2>

<p>When I’m happy with what I’ve written and have the edits committed, I make a copy of the file and paste it into a DropBox folder I share with my editor. She is then able to do anything she wants to the file. I make sure she knows I’ll find every character that changes when she’s done.</p>

<h2 id="3-reviewing-changes"><a href="#3-reviewing-changes"><span></span></a>3. Reviewing changes</h2>

<p>When I’m notified that she’s done editing the piece, I create a branch off of the master branch. I simply name the new branch after the article or chapter that I’ll be reviewing.</p>

<p>After creating the new branch and switching to it, I replace my version of the file with the edited version. It’s a simple copy, paste, and confirm to replace the current version.</p>

<p>I can then go into GitHub and see all of the changes highlighted. If I want to accept her change, I do nothing. They will come through later. If I want to ignore her change or make tweaks, I go to the file and make the edits. Then I return to GitHub and keep working through the article.</p>

<p>When I’ve finished reviewing the changes and making my final edits, I commit the edited file to my newly created branch and then merge the new branch into the master. I could probably do this from the master branch but it just feels weird bringing someone else’s changes directly into the main structure. I prefer not to hear the neurotic developer in me screaming.</p>

<h2 id="tracking"><a href="#tracking"><span></span></a>Tracking</h2>

<p>Something I’ve wanted to do with my writing for a while is track how many words I’ve written each day. Thankfully, using GitHub makes it possible to pull this off. It’s really technical, so I would say <strong>this part is for the power users</strong>.</p>

<p>With a Git repository, you can set up hooks to run when certain events happen. In other words, I can run a script when something happens in the repository. In this case, I used the “post-commit” hook because I wanted to run a script after I commit changes.</p>

<p>I added this code to the post-commit executable found in the “.git” directory of my writing repository:</p>

<noscript><pre>PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin
#!/bin/bash
gitbranch=`git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`
if [ $gitbranch = &quot;master&quot; ]; then
	date=`date +%m/%d/%Y`
	datetime=`date +%r`
	gitwa=`git diff HEAD^ HEAD --word-diff=porcelain | grep -e &quot;^+[^+]&quot; | wc -w`
	gitwd=`git diff HEAD^ HEAD --word-diff=porcelain | grep -e &quot;^-[^-]&quot; | wc -w`
	commit=`git log -1 --pretty=%B`
	cnt=`expr $gitwa - $gitwd`
	theURL=&#39;https://script.google.com/a/macros/username/s/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/exec&#39;
	curl -L --get $theURL --data-urlencode &quot;Date=$date&quot; --data-urlencode &quot;Time=$datetime&quot; --data-urlencode &quot;WordCount=$cnt&quot; --data-urlencode &quot;Commit=$commit&quot; --data-urlencode &quot;Adds=$gitwa&quot; --data-urlencode &quot;Deletes=$gitwd&quot;
fi</pre></noscript>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/joebuhlig/b0c3cd227c148685f98d.js"> </script>

<p>It checks to see if the commit is in the master branch. If it is, then it counts the words that have been added and subtracts the number of words that were removed. That number is then sent to a Google Sheet through a Google Script that I’ve published as a web app.</p>

<p>From the spreadsheet I can see each commit, the date and time of the commit, and how many words I wrote. I like seeing how much progress I’m making and can potentially use this data to find cycles in my writing patterns. If nothing else, it’s fun.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/OmniFocus-Auto-Parser.jpg" /><p>I love it when my systems do things automatically. In this case, I can capture an idea for a someday/maybe list and it ends up in the right place in OmniFocus.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I wrote about my original process for this <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/using-omnifocus-for-somedaymaybe-lists/">here</a>, but I’ve since refined it. I didn’t like having an extra app icon sitting in my dock. I knew there had to be a better way to do it… and I found it.</p>

<p>I’m now using a launch agent. If that sounds intimidating, I completely understand. I originally stayed away because I thought it would be too complicated. But it turned out to be less difficult than I expected. If you need help falling asleep tonight, you can <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPSystemStartup/Chapters/CreatingLaunchdJobs.html">read more about them</a> on Apple’s developer site.</p>

<p>It’s possible that I’ll be making updates to this code in the future, so I added this to a new GitHub repository I’ve created: <a href="https://github.com/joebuhlig/OFScripts">OFScripts</a>. All of the code and instructions for how to install it can be found there.</p>

<p>From a high-level view, here’s what happens:</p>

<h2 id="1-when-you-log-in"><a href="#1-when-you-log-in"><span></span></a>1. When you log in</h2>

<p>The launch agent starts running when you log into your account. That’s all a launch agent does. It is a process that runs at log in. It can either run once or on intervals in the background. In this case, it runs at a specified interval.</p>

<h2 id="2-run-applescript"><a href="#2-run-applescript"><span></span></a>2. Run AppleScript</h2>

<p>The launch agent is set up to run an AppleScript. It runs first when when you log in and continues to run on an interval afterwards.</p>

<h2 id="3-parse-your-omnifocus-inbox"><a href="#3-parse-your-omnifocus-inbox"><span></span></a>3. Parse your OmniFocus inbox</h2>

<p>The AppleScript takes your OmniFocus inbox and parses any tasks that start with “–“. You can learn how to create the parsing strings in <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/using-omnifocus-for-somedaymaybe-lists/">my original post</a>.</p>

<p>This system has become integral to my use of OmniFocus. With this running in the background, I can now email tasks directly into a project and context. The big one for me is the ability to use <a href="http://agiletortoise.com/drafts/">Drafts</a>(<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts-4-quickly-capture-notes/id905337691?mt=8">iTunes</a>) to automatically send tasks to a specific project and context. It makes it incredibly simple to get things into OmniFocus.</p>

<p><strong>Updates:</strong></p>

<p><strong>20150908:</strong> Patrick at <a href="http://schreibloga.de">http://schreibloga.de</a> was kind enough to write a python install script that you can run from command line to make the installation process a bit easier. You can find it in the GitHub repo here: <a href="https://github.com/joebuhlig/OFScripts">OFScripts</a></p>

<p><strong>20150908:</strong> I had a quick back and forth with Tim Stringer at <a href="http://learnomnifocus.com/?ref=11">Learn OmniFocus</a> about the AppleScript for this. We found a way to use Hazel to trigger this immediately when a new item comes to the inbox. If you’re a Hazel user, you can set up this rule on your OmniFocus database which is located here:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">/Users/YourUsername/Library/Containers/com.omnigroup.OmniFocus2/Data/Library/Application Support/OmniFocus</code></p>

<p>This has become my preferred way to use the script.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/Workflow-to-Share-Articles-with-Twitter-Handle.jpg" /><p>I like to share articles on <a href="https://twitter.com/joebuhlig">Twitter</a>. And I want to make sure I give the author credit in the tweet. But it’s not always easy to find their Twitter handle.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I can usually track it down, but I can quickly derail and find myself down a rabbit hole of links. I’m on a mission, but it’s too easy to click on another article and lose 20 minutes.</p>

<p>I mentioned the app <a href="https://workflow.is">Workflow</a> (<a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/workflow-powerful-automation/id915249334?mt=8&amp;at=1l3vnyQ">iTunes</a>) on my <a href="http://macsparky.com/blog/2015/7/home-screens-joe-buhlig">home screen post</a> for MacSparky’s site. It’s a tool that I continue finding more uses for. In this case, I found a way to search the source code of an article to find all the potential Twitter handles on the page.</p>

<h2 id="caveats"><a href="#caveats"><span></span></a>Caveats</h2>

<p>Making this happen was easier than I was expecting, but there are a few caveats you should be aware of <strong>before using this</strong>:</p>

<p>1. Intent, Share, Sharer</p>

<p>There are times when the list of handles shows up and has one of these values. It’s because the article has a share bar of some kind on it. I could find a way to exclude these from the list but it wasn’t a quick fix for me and I didn’t want to spend too much time on it.</p>

<p>2. Not 100%</p>

<p>If there’s a handle on the page, the workflow usually finds them. But there are instances where I know that a handle is in the article and it still doesn’t find it. I haven’t been able to track down why, but it’s infrequent enough that I don’t worry about it.</p>

<h2 id="how-it-works"><a href="#how-it-works"><span></span></a>How it works</h2>

<p>You can <a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/6ba3ee1f5f7d4be7bfbe5ed867848662">find the workflow here</a>, but here’s the process:</p>

<p>1. Get the URL and expand it</p>

<p>I use this primarily from Pocket. It drives me crazy when services shorten links with their own shortener. So the first thing the workflow does is get the URL from the input and expand it. It then takes the expanded URL and saves it to a variable for later.</p>

<p>2. Get URL contents and make HTML</p>

<p>It then takes the URL, fetches the content of the webpage, and creates an HTML document from it. This is what allows searching in the next step.</p>

<p>3. Search for Twitter handles</p>

<p>Using a RegEx search string, it looks for anything that looks like a Twitter handle in the source HTML. It takes the results of that search and adds it to a list that you choose from.</p>

<p>4. Create the share string</p>

<p>The last step is to create the string of text that will be passed to the share sheet. It uses the expanded URL from the beginning and the handle you selected to create the string. You can alter this for yours if you like a different format.</p>

<h2 id="using-the-workflow"><a href="#using-the-workflow"><span></span></a>Using the workflow</h2>

<p>When you find an article you want to share, invoke the share sheet and hit Run Workflow. Select this workflow and wait for it to ask which Twitter handle to use. Once you’ve selected one, the share sheet will pop up again and you can pick your method of sharing. It will dump the created share string into the application. All you have to do is add your comment to the beginning of the string. Poof!</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> I had a number of requests to add the title of the article to the tweet. I wanted to encourage myself to add an original comment about the article, but sometimes want this as well. So I went ahead and <a href="https://workflow.is/workflows/6898d8d15333417fa6da8ab316c32c5b">created another version</a> that adds the title to the beginning of the tweet. Enjoy!</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/How-I-Use-the-M.O.U.S.-9.jpg" /><p>I pulled my computer mouse out of my bag and the first thing he said was, “What on earth is that thing?” It was yet another confirmation that I’m strange.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I’ve had it referred to as the Batmobile or Stealth Mouse. Maybe that’s just because I have the matte black version, but with all the buttons and wings this is definitely not your normal computer mouse.</p>

<p>It’s the <a href="http://store.madcatz.com/categories/mice-category/Mad-Catz-MOUS-9.html">Mad Catz M.O.U.S. 9</a>. I picked it up when it was first released a few years ago. I noticed my right wrist was beginning to hurt after working on the computer all day and wanted to slow down or stop the damage that was happening.</p>

<p>I found ways to limit the time I spent using the mouse in the first place with tools like <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a> and <a href="https://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/index.html">TextExpander</a>, but I knew I needed to find a more ergonomic mouse. That’s when I discovered the M.O.U.S. 9. It’s essentially an office version of the <a href="http://store.madcatz.com/categories/mice-category/Mad-Catz-RAT-9-Wireless-Gaming-Mouse-for-PC-and-Mac.html">R.A.T. 9</a>, which is primarily used for gaming.</p>

<p>Because it was designed for gamers, the R.A.T. 9 is ergonomic and built for heavy use. Comparing my computer use with a gamer isn’t a clean parallel, but there are similarities. We both can spend long hours on the computer and try to be as quick and efficient with keystrokes and mouse clicks as possible. The R.A.T. made sense to me. But I didn’t care for the corded receiver of the R.A.T. 9, so I picked up the M.O.U.S. 9 which is nearly identical but has a low profile USB receiver.</p>

<p>I should note that one of the main reasons I looked at these in the first place was my use of a <a href="http://www.epicgear.com/en/technologies/types-of-mouse-grip">claw grip</a>. I need to have good palm support so the adjustable palm rest is primarily what sold me. And I knew I would geek out on the extra buttons as well.</p>

<p>Over time, I’ve fine-tuned the extra buttons and found them to be incredibly useful in every day use. Outside of the typical left/right click, here’s how I have it set up:</p>

<h2 id="1-mission-control"><a href="#1-mission-control"><span></span></a>1. Mission Control</h2>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-medium" src="/assets/posts_extra/MOUS9-MissionControl.png" /></p>

<p>I like using the three finger swipe gesture on the trackpad to invoke Mission Control, but when I have my computer sitting on boxes (because I’m too cheap for a stand right now) I can’t use it. So I have the center button set to trigger Mission Control.</p>

<h2 id="2-copypaste"><a href="#2-copypaste"><span></span></a>2. Copy/Paste</h2>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-medium" src="/assets/posts_extra/MOUS9-CopyPaste.png" /></p>

<p>When working with data or code, I’m often selecting cells or text, copying, selecting a different location, and pasting it in. It’s typically mouse heavy work, but switching back to the keyboard for the copy/paste steps. By setting the scroll wheel clicks to copy/paste, I can do all of it right from the mouse.</p>

<h2 id="3-playpause"><a href="#3-playpause"><span></span></a>3. Play/Pause</h2>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-medium" src="/assets/posts_extra/MOUS9-PlayPause.png" /></p>

<p>I get a fair number of phone calls and watch a number of how-to videos on YouTube. That means I’m hitting pause on my music quite a bit throughout the day. It’s something I want to be able to do fast, so I programmed the wing button to toggle play/pause on whatever I’m listening to.</p>

<h2 id="4-horizontal-scrolling"><a href="#4-horizontal-scrolling"><span></span></a>4. Horizontal Scrolling</h2>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-medium" src="/assets/posts_extra/MOUS9-HorizontalScroll.png" /></p>

<p>With a second scroll wheel it made sense to set it up for horizontal scrolling. I wasn’t sure I would use it. But after having it available, I found myself using it on spreadsheets and websites quite a bit. It’s definitely nice to have.</p>

<h2 id="5-nextprevious-tab"><a href="#5-nextprevious-tab"><span></span></a>5. Next/Previous Tab</h2>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-medium" src="/assets/posts_extra/MOUS9-NextPrevTab.png" /></p>

<p>I have a lot of browser tabs open when I’m doing development work or research for an article. It can get a little ridiculous. I can have 30 tabs going at once. Control + Tab is my friend, but I find my hand on the mouse a lot when I’m looking through webpages. I set up the side buttons to navigate forward and backward through the tabs so I can cycle through them faster.</p>

<h2 id="6-back"><a href="#6-back"><span></span></a>6. Back</h2>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-medium" src="/assets/posts_extra/MOUS9-Back.png" /></p>

<p>Similar to number five, I’m frequently going back a page in the browser. I have the circular side button set up to take me back a page. This also works well in other applications. For example, I can go to the last note I was looking at in Evernote using this button.</p>

<p>If you’re in the market for a new mouse and want something ergonomic that has more features than you should be allowed to use, take a look at the M.O.U.S. 9. I recommend it and I’m not even an affiliate.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/First-Apps-on-a-New-Mac.jpg" /><p>Last week, I mentioned I had purchased a new MacBook Pro. Instead of the migration process, I set it up as a new machine. That means I had to decide which apps needed to be installed first. Simple, right? Well, not so much.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I had to be specific about the order I installed apps because there are a few that the others are dependent on.</p>

<p>I told my wife that I’m useless on a stock Mac. It’s so true. I hit keyboard commands and nothing happens. I stare at the screen trying to figure out what’s wrong with it.</p>

<p>So here’s the first five apps I installed on the new MBP, in order of installation:</p>

<h2 id="dropbox"><a href="#dropbox"><span></span></a>DropBox</h2>

<p>If an app allows me to sync my data using DropBox, that’s what I use. DropBox holds so much data for other apps that I want to have the data available before I install the app itself. It’s vital to pulling in settings, data, and files that I use to customize my computer.</p>

<h2 id="1password"><a href="#1password"><span></span></a>1Password</h2>

<p>I sync my 1Password data via DropBox. So once DropBox was installed, I could install 1Password. Since 1Password stores all of my software licenses and passwords, it’s vital to have it in place before I install anything else on a new computer. It makes the login and license key entry process tolerable for the remainder of the setup.</p>

<h2 id="textexpander"><a href="#textexpander"><span></span></a>TextExpander</h2>

<p>TextExpander does a lot of work for me. One of its primary uses is filling in forms with my email addresses. When doing computer setup, you end up typing your email address constantly. I wasn’t about to go through the login processes without it. And again, my TextExpander data is being synced via DropBox.</p>

<h2 id="omnifocus"><a href="#omnifocus"><span></span></a>OmniFocus</h2>

<p>I don’t use DropBox for OmniFocus, but I do need to be able to use the Quick Entry of OmniFocus to capture tasks. This is especially true when setting up a new computer. I just knew I would be installing one app and remember that I wanted to change some settings in another. I needed to have OmniFocus available to capture the new stuff.</p>

<h2 id="alfred"><a href="#alfred"><span></span></a>Alfred</h2>

<p>Alfred is my preference in keyboard launchers. I have some workflows and keyboard commands set up to bring my most common programs to the front. For everything else, I invoke Alfred, start typing the name of the app, and hit enter. This saves me a lot of clicks when I have a bunch of new apps to open up.</p>

<p>DropBox syncs the data behind 1Password and TextExpander, which are vital for app installation. OmniFocus helps me remember what to do and capture new tasks. Alfred makes it easy to get the new apps going. Once these five are in place, I’m off to the races.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/Macbook-Pro-Vs-MacBook-Air.jpg" /><p>I’ve recently undergone a work transition that led me to purchasing a new MacBook Pro. My traveling work machine was a MacBook Air and I’ve found a few differences in the two that make me wish I’d done this earlier.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="my-computer-uses"><a href="#my-computer-uses"><span></span></a>My computer uses</h2>

<p>These debates are worthless if you don’t understand the purpose of the machines. Someone who lives in email all day has no real use for a fully upgraded Mac Pro. Unless, of course, they just really like the Mac Pro, have $10,000 to blow, and like watching 18 YouTube videos at once on three 2k monitors. Then it makes perfect sense.</p>

<p>I’m a technology <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/contact/">consultant</a> and developer. I’m also starting up a <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/whaddyaknowjoe/">podcast</a> and writing a <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/omnifocus/">book</a>. I need a machine that can handle writing (articles, books, emails, and a lot of code) and audio editing. My wife does design work on the same computer, so there’s also a need for a quality screen and the ability to run the Adobe programs.</p>

<p>I used the MacBook Air while working for my previous employer. That job required me to use some PC-based programs, so I used Parallels and Windows. The new computer doesn’t need to do that. I’m 100% Apple at this point.</p>

<p>Here’s the breakdown of the two computers:</p>

<h2 id="the-macbook-air-mid-2013"><a href="#the-macbook-air-mid-2013"><span></span></a>The MacBook Air (mid-2013)</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Screen: 13 inch</li>
  <li>Processor: 1.7 GHz i7</li>
  <li>Ram: 8 GB</li>
  <li>Hard Drive: 512 GB Flash</li>
  <li>Model: A1466</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-macbook-pro-early-2015"><a href="#the-macbook-pro-early-2015"><span></span></a>The MacBook Pro (early-2015)</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Screen: 13 inch (retina)</li>
  <li>Processor: 2.7 GHz i5</li>
  <li>Ram: 8 GB</li>
  <li>Hard Drive: 128 GB SSD</li>
  <li>Model: A1502</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="downgraded-hard-drive"><a href="#downgraded-hard-drive"><span></span></a>Downgraded hard drive?</h2>

<p>All of the numbers either go up and stay the same except the hard drive. Some of my reasoning for that is price. SSDs are still pretty expensive and I already have 5 TBs of external hard drives that are grossly underused. I don’t need more storage right now.</p>

<p>I did some diagnostics on the MBA and found that if I pulled the Parallels/Windows process from the machine, I would have been using about 125 GB on the hard drive. I also never shifted files from the internal hard drive. So the shift to a much smaller hard drive was easy to justify for me. I could easily use <a href="http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php">Hazel</a> to help me keep the MBP clean and keep cold-storage files on an external.</p>

<h3 id="1-screen-resolution"><a href="#1-screen-resolution"><span></span></a>1. Screen Resolution</h3>

<p>I hadn’t looked at a retina display before I bought the MBP. I had read enough reviews from people that swear by it and say they’re ruined once they’ve used one. Listen to them. They are absolutely right. You can’t go back.</p>

<p>I was setting up the MBP as a new machine while referencing the MBA. I eventually needed to let my eyes adjust to the MBA before I could work on it. Sure I’m neurotic and picky, but yes, the MBP was that much better.</p>

<p>It’s easy to say that the retina display is amazing. I don’t think anyone will argue with that. Is it worth the extra money for a MBP right now? If you’re doing development or design of any kind, the retina display is a must.</p>

<h3 id="2-weight"><a href="#2-weight"><span></span></a>2. Weight</h3>

<p>I didn’t notice this at first, but I know a number of people complain about it - the weight of the MBP vs the MBA. There’s about one pound difference between them.</p>

<p>I actually prefer the heavier MBP in this case. I’ve always felt that I was about to break the MBA when I’m opening the lid. My wife can attest to me being good at pushing things too far and breaking them (for some inexplicable reason, not everything is as durable as a tractor). So I was always a bit paranoid about snapping off the screen.</p>

<p>The MBP is solid. It doesn’t pick the front of the computer up off the table when I try to open it with one hand. I really like that. It just feels like it’ll last forever and will take more abuse than the MBA. I just need to remember not to take advantage of that.</p>

<h3 id="3-keyboard"><a href="#3-keyboard"><span></span></a>3. Keyboard</h3>

<p>Ok, someone tell me I’m wrong here, but there’s a different keyboard in the MBP. It’s not super clicky, but it’s not real light either. I didn’t care for how light the response was on the MBA and I’ve always felt the Apple Bluetooth keyboards were too much. But the MBP has a nice balance between the two.</p>

<p>My only trouble with this is that I’ll be putting the MBP into a laptop stand of some kind (likely sitting on top of boxes) so I won’t actually be using the built-in keyboard for the majority of the time. I’ll be using the Apple Bluetooth keyboard.</p>

<p>At this point, I’m splitting hairs. There’s only a very slight difference between the two that I can feel. So slight, that it has zero effect on my typing speed and ability. I’m just saying that I prefer the keyboard on the MBP to the external.</p>

<h2 id="post-mortem"><a href="#post-mortem"><span></span></a>Post-mortem</h2>

<p>I’m pretty stoked about having the MBP over the MBA. I know I’ll need to clear the hard drive more diligently, but that’s easy enough. Everything else says I made the right decision.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/Why-I-use-OmniFocus.jpg" /><p>Task managers. There are so many options available and it’s painful making a decision, especially when it takes real dollars to get into them.
<!--more--></p>

<p>There’s a lot of hype around to-do list apps, but I’m not known for jumping into an app just because people are excited about it. And with task managers, I knew I was picky. I did the normal thing and ran Google searches to find out what the broader internet prefers. It was a mixed bag and that was three years ago. It’s worse now.</p>

<p>Not knowing whose opinion to trust, I pulled together my list of needs in a task manager. I compared that to the list of task managers I could find and quickly concluded that <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/tag/omnifocus/">OmniFocus</a> was my only real option.</p>

<p>I recently tried this again to see if there were new options that met my criteria, but I came up short. It seems the <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/">OmniGroup</a> is the only team thinking detailed enough to fit my needs.</p>

<h2 id="design"><a href="#design"><span></span></a>Design</h2>

<p>I’ve done enough UI/UX design and development to realize that the OmniFocus interface is pretty sophisticated. You can tell that every line and every pixel is in place for a reason. They’ve thought it through enough to get the interface out of the way and let you work. That’s tough to pull off.</p>

<p>If the design (what it looks like <em>and</em> how you use it) of an application isn’t simple, appealing, and highly functioning, I delete it. I know that there are enough options out there that I’ll find what I’m looking for or I’ll build it myself.</p>

<h2 id="trust"><a href="#trust"><span></span></a>Trust</h2>

<p>I have to know that my data is safe. If I’m developing a web application, the action steps to complete it cannot disappear. And they cannot duplicate. I can’t worry about my task lists <em>and</em> the task itself.</p>

<p>I’ve never had problems with one of OmniGroup’s products and I don’t hear of many (if any) data issues that aren’t user-induced. If they introduce a product or feature, it just works.</p>

<h2 id="defer-dates"><a href="#defer-dates"><span></span></a>Defer dates</h2>

<p>This is a big sticking point that no other app handles correctly and a lot of OmniFocus users mention as a selling point. It’s like a snooze button for tasks. I need to be able to put tasks off until later. Let me give you a date and time of when I want to see that task again.</p>

<p>This is <em>not</em> a due date. Using arbitrary due dates will get you in trouble every time.</p>

<p>Right now I’m recovering from surgery and have a 10 lb lifting restriction. That means I can’t work on most of my DIY projects. So I defer them to keep my lists from being cluttered.</p>

<p>OmniFocus is the only application I’ve found that handles this. And it does it beautifully.</p>

<h2 id="project-planning"><a href="#project-planning"><span></span></a>Project planning</h2>

<p>The ability to edit tasks by project and also by context seems simple. But I was amazed by the number of GTD-centric apps that don’t have this. It’s one of the foundations of the framework. I need a list of projects with the next action for each, and every action must have a context. Conclusion: I need to see tasks by project <em>and</em> by context.</p>

<h2 id="applescript"><a href="#applescript"><span></span></a>AppleScript</h2>

<p>I do a lot of customization and automation. And my task manager is not exempt. I need it to integrate with everything I do on my Mac. From automatically parsing tasks to adding tasks, it needs to fit in.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, I only have one choice. And it’s one that I’ve grown to really enjoy. OmniFocus is a killer task manager that looks nice and gets out of the way when I need to work.</p>

<p>P.S. You can find a lot more detail about OmniFocus in <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/omnifocus/">my book</a>. But I’d like to finish writing it first.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/An-Alternative-to-Annual-Goals.jpg" /><p>I’ve been struggling with goal-setting lately, enough that I <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/from-goals-to-guides/">abandoned my annual goals altogether</a>. But I’ve found that I want something to help guide the systems that I’m putting in place.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="traditional-goal-setting"><a href="#traditional-goal-setting"><span></span></a>Traditional goal-setting</h2>

<p>In the past, I’ve set personal and professional goals annually using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria">SMART</a> method. It gave me a sense of pride. I knew I was on a path to do some big things. And that was great motivation at the onset of the year.</p>

<p>But after a month, (sometimes two), I forgot about my goals and drift from thing to thing. The shiny new object motivation was gone. And more often than not, there would be a change in the circumstances or assumptions that my goals were based on. If I could, I would re-factor them and start again.</p>

<p>By the end of the year, my goals looked nothing like the originals. And in most cases, I failed to hit them. Year after year of the same process finally frustrated me enough to stop and think about the foundation of goal-setting.</p>

<h2 id="the-alternative"><a href="#the-alternative"><span></span></a>The alternative</h2>

<p>I reflected on my inability to complete goals and looked for patterns. It turned out that every three months I was trying to re-imagine my goals for the year. I was setting goals quarterly, but didn’t consider altering their deadlines to reflect the changes. If I’m naturally setting goals quarterly, why not embrace it?</p>

<p>I’m just starting this journey, but here’s why I think this could work:</p>

<h3 id="1-not-too-long"><a href="#1-not-too-long"><span></span></a>1. Not too long</h3>

<p>Life happens too fast for annual goals. Circumstances and mindsets can change quickly and a year is too long. I found myself waiting for the year to end so that I could start something new. Why wait if I’ve abandoned or completed my original goal?</p>

<p>Moving to a shorter time period allows me to accept my three month cycle.</p>

<h3 id="2-shiny-new-object-motivation"><a href="#2-shiny-new-object-motivation"><span></span></a>2. Shiny new object motivation</h3>

<p>I can take advantage of my excitement at the onset. I’m usually pretty stoked to get started on new goals. If I’m planning more frequently, I can use the early motivation to accomplish things faster and gain focus.</p>

<h3 id="3-success-cycle"><a href="#3-success-cycle"><span></span></a>3. Success cycle</h3>

<p>I’m lacking the drive that comes from successfully reaching a goal. When I achieve a goal, I get excited and want to do more. By using shorter periods, I have more opportunities for success and can create a cycle of winning.</p>

<h2 id="my-plan"><a href="#my-plan"><span></span></a>My plan</h2>

<p>I’m just coming to this idea and haven’t tested it… at all. It’s a journey that I’ll do my best to share. My plan for the next week is to set goals for the next 3 months, share as many of them as I can with you, and let you know how it goes.</p>

<p>That’s the goal anyway.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/Routine-vs-Ritual.jpg" /><p>A while back I read <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/power-full-engagement-book-review/">The Power of Full Engagement</a>. The premise of the book is energy management and what you do each day to gain or use energy.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>The book mentions some specific rituals that give people energy. I’m obsessed with the routines I do each day, so I was fascinated. I’m always reading what others do in an effort to find one thing that will make my day super productive.</p>

<p>But routines don’t necessarily motivate me throughout the day. They may keep me on track, but they’re often draining and mundane. And no fun at all. To prevent burnout, some of those tasks need to be enjoyable. Ultimately, it comes down to the difference between routines and rituals.</p>

<h2 id="routine"><a href="#routine"><span></span></a>Routine</h2>

<p>I think of routines as checklists or a structure in which I act. It can be a list of things I do in the morning or the process of getting my kids down for bed. In either case, there is a series of tasks that I do consistently and in the same order.</p>

<p>Inside routines, I don’t have to think about what comes next. I do them frequently and I can do them without looking at a list. They remove the stress on my brain and help me accomplish a task quickly and efficiently, but they don’t necessarily recharge me.</p>

<p>Common routines: preparing work for the day, mowing the lawn, bedtimes.</p>

<h2 id="ritual"><a href="#ritual"><span></span></a>Ritual</h2>

<p>Rituals are similar to routines since they are also a series of tasks that are completed in the same order. But a ritual’s intent is to provide energy and enjoyment along with structure. A ritual is a carefully selected process that has a positive side effect outside of the task being completed.</p>

<p>Common rituals: meditation, daily walk, reading a book.</p>

<h2 id="from-routine-to-ritual"><a href="#from-routine-to-ritual"><span></span></a>From routine to ritual</h2>

<p>I’ve taken detailed notes by hand in meetings for a while. I never enjoyed it. I kept trying to collect the notes digitally, but it never felt fluid enough.</p>

<p>Sometimes you have to deal with a less-than-ideal process and sometimes you can find a way to make it more enjoyable. In this case, I decided to make the note-taking something that I like doing. I bought a fountain pen. I’m intrigued by the old-fashioned way of doing things and this was a perfect fit. Using the fountain pen is a joy for me so taking notes and marking them up afterwards became a ritual instead of just a routine. I enjoy doing it because I enjoy using my fountain pen.</p>

<p>There is a balance to be found with routine and ritual. We’ll always have routines that we need to do. But there’s a lot of value in finding routines, (or at least parts of routines), that we can turn into rituals.</p>

<p>Your brain thinks that remembering dog food is just as important as remembering that meeting with your largest client. They take up the same amount of space in your mind. Unless you have multiple reminders, it’s easy to forget tasks and ideas at all levels of importance.</p>

<p>I’ve found that with the vast amount of information that floods my mind every day, I’m better off using an external system to keep it all straight. I can’t trust my mind so I need help remembering. Enter TheBrain.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-thebrain"><a href="#what-is-thebrain"><span></span></a>What is TheBrain?</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.thebrain.com/">TheBrain</a> is mind-mapping software on steroids. It allows you to create Thoughts (think of these as nodes in mind-mapping) that are linked in multiple places. A single Thought can have multiple parents, multiple children, and multiple “jump” Thoughts. The Jump Thoughts are the oddballs and also where the magic happens. I found it hard to understand until I saw an example, so I recommend taking a quick look at <a href="http://jerrysbrain.com">Jerry’s Brain</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Jump Thought Example</strong>: Sam lives in Utah. Sam is not the United States, so he’s not Utah’s parent. He’s also not a city of Utah, so he’s not a child. But I still want Sam connected to Utah. So I add Sam as a Jump Thought to Utah. Now when I’m looking at the Thought for Sam, I can see Utah. And when I’m looking at the Thought for Utah, I can see Sam.</p>

<h2 id="uses"><a href="#uses"><span></span></a>Uses</h2>

<h3 id="1-contacts"><a href="#1-contacts"><span></span></a>1. Contacts</h3>

<p>This isn’t an address book as much as a connection book. TheBrain makes it possible to create connections between people and concepts, ideas, and locations. The power of this comes with the review process later. Before I meet with someone, I’ll pull up TheBrain to see what connections I have with them. It helps me remember that Jill is a homeschooler who likes fountain pens even if I haven’t seen Jill in a year or two. And if I’m honest, it makes small talk for an introvert easier.</p>

<h3 id="2-concepts"><a href="#2-concepts"><span></span></a>2. Concepts</h3>

<p>These are ideas or systems that I enjoy or participate in - developing intuition, dash/plus note-taking, GTD, etc… If I keep these in TheBrain, I can make connections to other people, tools, and locations, but I can also see a list of my favorite concepts. It’s interesting how many new ideas I get when I see these side by side.</p>

<h3 id="3-service-providers"><a href="#3-service-providers"><span></span></a>3. Service Providers</h3>

<p>How handy would it be to see all of the mechanics that you know? How about all of the physicians or lawyers? That’s exactly what this does. When I have work done or have someone recommended, I put them here.</p>

<h3 id="4-interests"><a href="#4-interests"><span></span></a>4. Interests</h3>

<p>This is similar to concepts, but it’s more about specific things - fountains pens, homeschooling, scotch, espresso. Again, I can use these to make connections elsewhere.</p>

<h3 id="5-autobiography"><a href="#5-autobiography"><span></span></a>5. Autobiography</h3>

<p>Sometimes I forget when an event in my life happened. So I’ve started logging big events in TheBrain. I have Child Thoughts under this for Education, Hobbies, and Timeline. The first two are easy, but the last is the most helpful. If an event happens that I want to log, I put it here under the appropriate date. I can add notes about it but I can also give it Jump Thoughts for the location, any people involved, or anything else that I may want to recall. It’s nice to know who helped me out when I was doing <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/a-chaotic-week-with-gtd/">foundation work on my house</a>.</p>

<h3 id="6-locations"><a href="#6-locations"><span></span></a>6. Locations</h3>

<p>I travel regularly and I’m reaching a point where it’s hard to remember who I’ve met and where. I also like seeing what I’ve done in different places. So I add locations here as I need and use them as Jump Thoughts elsewhere. Having them collected in one place makes it easy to see all the things I’ve done or know about a place.</p>

<h3 id="7-tools"><a href="#7-tools"><span></span></a>7. Tools</h3>

<p>These are mostly apps that I use. I sometimes like to see what concepts or interests are connected to these apps. I can also connect these to contacts that use them as well. It’s fun to ask someone how their use of Evernote has changed over the last two years when you haven’t seen them. It usually sparks a fun, geeky conversation.</p>

<h3 id="8-influentials"><a href="#8-influentials"><span></span></a>8. Influentials</h3>

<p>These are people that have had a big impact on me in some way. They’ve been mentors, confidants, or all-around wise people that I enjoy being around. If I have an opportunity to be around these people, I will take it every time I can.</p>

<h2 id="guidelines"><a href="#guidelines"><span></span></a>Guidelines</h2>

<p>There isn’t a list of best practices anywhere on how to use TheBrain (that I’ve found) and I certainly wouldn’t tell you that there’s a bad way to use it. But here are a few pointers:</p>

<h3 id="1-single-brain"><a href="#1-single-brain"><span></span></a>1. Single Brain</h3>

<p>I can have multiple Brains! But it’s not a good idea. I tried it once and found that I was switching a lot. It’s easier to create a new branch off the Home Thought and work from there. It also allows you to create more connections in the long run.</p>

<h3 id="2-using-jump-thoughts"><a href="#2-using-jump-thoughts"><span></span></a>2. Using Jump Thoughts</h3>

<p>Be very clear on what is a Parent Thought and what is a Child Thought. Everything else is a Jump Thought. States or regions are children of countries. People can be parents of concepts (ex. David Allen and GTD). But a coworker may be a Jump Thought of a concept. They aren’t the creator of the concept and it would seem silly to have someone as a child of a concept. Create a Jump Thought for the relationship in order to see the connection later.</p>

<h3 id="3-leverage-notes"><a href="#3-leverage-notes"><span></span></a>3. Leverage Notes</h3>

<p>This is especially useful if you have contacts in your Brain. Use the notes field to capture someone’s background or to take notes on your last conversation with them. Use them as they’re intended - for taking notes.</p>

<h3 id="4-orphaned-thoughts"><a href="#4-orphaned-thoughts"><span></span></a>4. Orphaned Thoughts</h3>

<p>Don’t be afraid to have Thoughts out there without a Parent or Child Thought. If you start to create a connection in the future, the search mechanism will still show them and you can continue building connections off of them.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/Different-Uses-for-Evernote.jpg" /><p>At 13,000 notes, I like to think I’m a big user of Evernote. From meeting notes and travel receipts to manuals and quotes, I keep a lot in Evernote.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>And there are a lot of conventional ways that you see Evernote being used - packing lists, research, household item photos, journaling, and many others. But I want to share a few ways I use Evernote that I haven’t see elsewhere on the web.</p>

<h2 id="social-media-logging"><a href="#social-media-logging"><span></span></a>Social Media Logging</h2>

<p>I have a handful of rules in <a href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a> that automatically create notes in Evernote when a new post, favorite, or like happens on social media. I’m often wanting to go back to something I saw on Vimeo or Instagram and can’t find it. If I favorited a photo in Instagram, I know that it’s easier to find it in Evernote than to go searching the depths of the Instagram feed.</p>

<p>It’s also nice to have a log of all your updates that you can quickly reference. I have a saved search (any: tag:”twitterx” tag: “tumblrx” tag:”linkedinx” tag:”instagramx” tag:”youtubex” tag:”vimeox” tag:”facebookx”) that I can sort by created date and see my recent activity across all social media sites. I just need a way to add Pinterest and Google Plus and I’ll be set.</p>

<p>Evernote tags: twitterx, tumblrx, linkedinx, instagramx, vimeox, youtubex, facebookx</p>

<h2 id="presentations"><a href="#presentations"><span></span></a>Presentations</h2>

<p>I’m not talking about research or random ideas for presentations here. I’m talking about the presentations themselves. PowerPoint can create decent presentations and Keynote does a fair job as well. But the clean view of an Evernote presentation is tough to beat.</p>

<p>I treat a single note as a slide and create a master with links to each note in the presentation. I’ve always been terrible at sticking to a script. I like to feel my way through it and this allows me to skip around within the presentation.</p>

<p>Evernote tags: presentationx, wipx (I remove wipx after I’ve presented it.)</p>

<h2 id="article-history"><a href="#article-history"><span></span></a>Article History</h2>

<p>I’ve written about this one in the past, but you can <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/saving-full-articles-in-evernote-from-rss/">automatically save articles</a> you’ve read in Evernote through Pocket. I read a life-altering article about how to cuddle with a puppy and now I can’t find it. Creating a history of articles you’ve read ensures that you’ll never forget how to cuddle puppies.</p>

<p>Evernote tags: articlex</p>

<h2 id="kudos"><a href="#kudos"><span></span></a>Kudos</h2>

<p>You need to start this one! Any time someone praises something I’ve done or thanks me for helping them, I add it to Evernote. You never know when a bad day will come along and you need a pick-me-up.</p>

<p>Evernote tags: kudox</p>

<h2 id="rating-databases"><a href="#rating-databases"><span></span></a>Rating Databases</h2>

<p>This is similar to what a lot of people use Evernote for, but I add a twist to it. I collect pictures of scotch bottles, wine bottles, bags of coffee, and even restaurant signs. But I make sure I write a few notes about the item and tag it with a rating. That allows me to do a search like “restaurantx excellentx Atlanta” to find excellent restaurants I’ve been to in Atlanta.</p>

<p>Evernote tags: bunch of databases with <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/simple-trick-naming-tags/">“x” on the end</a>, terriblex, averagex, goodx, excellentx</p>

<p>I should note that I’ve been using Evernote less than I used to. I’ve found myself shifting over to plain text files and pdfs for general writing and quick captures, but these are some things that I’m continuing to keep in Evernote.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/My-Writing-Setup.jpg" /><p>It’s been a little over a year since I started blogging and I’ve had a number of folks ask me what tools I use to write my articles. This is an outline of my process from idea to publish.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="drafts"><a href="#drafts"><span></span></a>Drafts</h2>

<p>Most articles start as a small idea for me. I always capture these with my iPhone and <a href="http://agiletortoise.com/drafts/">Drafts</a>. Even if I originally captured the idea on a note card, I’ll enter it into Drafts. From there, they auto-magically end up on a <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/using-omnifocus-for-somedaymaybe-lists/">Someday/Maybe list in OmniFocus</a>. I’m lazy so I had to make it happen without any intervention.</p>

<h2 id="omnifocus"><a href="#omnifocus"><span></span></a>OmniFocus</h2>

<p>When I’m deciding what articles to write, I review my Blog Post Ideas list in <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus">OmniFocus</a> for inspiration. When I’ve decided which idea gets to move forward, I turn that task into a project using a template project. This ensures that I complete all the steps necessary to get a blog post out the door.</p>

<h2 id="sublime-text"><a href="#sublime-text"><span></span></a>Sublime Text</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text 3</a> is my writing environment of choice. I use it for writing code at work. It has a lot of features that I don’t use for writing articles, but the extensibility and full-screen writing are really nice.</p>

<p>I write primarily in Markdown and to give Sublime more abilities, I extended it to create my custom setup. You need to install the <a href="https://packagecontrol.io/installation">Package Installer</a> to get these, but here are the packages I use within Sublime:</p>

<h3 id="1-markdownediting"><a href="#1-markdownediting"><span></span></a>1. <a href="https://packagecontrol.io/packages/MarkdownEditing">MarkdownEditing</a></h3>

<p>This gives you special macros, themes, and other tools that make it easier to write Markdown in Sublime. Adding missing link labels, running LINT, and switching list types are just a few of the tools you get.</p>

<h3 id="2-markdown-preview"><a href="#2-markdown-preview"><span></span></a>2. <a href="https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Markdown%20Preview">Markdown Preview</a></h3>

<p>When I’m done with my article, I run a command to copy the HTML to my clipboard using Markdown Preview. This package also allows you to export it to a file or preview the article in a browser. I never preview Markdown. It’s rarely different than what I was thinking. I know HTML and write it a lot. If something is wrong at the end, I’ll tweak the raw code.</p>

<h3 id="3-monokai-extended"><a href="#3-monokai-extended"><span></span></a>3. <a href="https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Monokai%20Extended">Monokai Extended</a></h3>

<p>Every time an application introduces a Dark or Night Mode, I use it. I don’t like staring at a light bulb all day so I try to minimize the amount of whitespace on a screen and turn it into grayspace. Monokai Extended is a syntax highlighter and color theme that works really well for me and allows me to get that Dark Mode I want.</p>

<h3 id="4-wordcount"><a href="#4-wordcount"><span></span></a>4. <a href="https://packagecontrol.io/packages/WordCount">WordCount</a></h3>

<p>I like to know how long my articles are. So I installed this little package that gives me a live word count as I’m typing. But I usually write in Distraction-Free Mode within Sublime Text which removes the ability to see all menu and status bars. So, it’s apparently not that important.</p>

<h2 id="editorial"><a href="#editorial"><span></span></a>Editorial</h2>

<p>Once in a while I’m away from my computer and I have an idea for an article I’m in the middle of. In that case, I use <a href="http://omz-software.com/editorial/">Editorial</a> to edit text files on my iPhone or iPad.</p>

<h2 id="wordpress"><a href="#wordpress"><span></span></a>WordPress</h2>

<p>When it’s all done, I copy the HTML for an article in Sublime Text and paste it into WordPress. If I want to do anything special to the code, I do it there. Otherwise, I’m simply checking the preview for the article and preparing the plane for takeoff.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/From-Goals-to-Guides.jpg" /><p>Remember the goal setting push at the beginning of the year? I’ve done it professionally and personally every year for four years and it <em>can</em> be motivating.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>But the last month has been terrible when compared to my goals. My intentions for the year have been destroyed by things I couldn’t predict.</p>

<p>Maybe I’m just bad at being realistic with goals and make them too big. I break them down each month and week to make sure I’m making progress but I miss them about 75% of the time. That means I’m creating a long string of failures. As a recovering perfectionist, this is paralyzing.</p>

<h2 id="my-issues-with-goals"><a href="#my-issues-with-goals"><span></span></a>My issues with goals</h2>

<h3 id="1-circumstances"><a href="#1-circumstances"><span></span></a>1. Circumstances</h3>

<p>I had great intentions when I started the year and I felt that I was on a good path. And I was…for a few months. But simple things happen that have a ripple effect.</p>

<p>For example, we needed to do some work to the foundation of our house. I wasn’t planning to do that when I set goals for the year. It gave me a <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/a-chaotic-week-with-gtd/">topic for a blog post</a>, but other than that it only had negative effects on my other goals.</p>

<p>I found myself tweaking my goals (and feeling guilty about it) every time I had something come up that would alter the course. So… why am I setting them to begin with if I’m changing them all year long?</p>

<h3 id="2-time"><a href="#2-time"><span></span></a>2. Time</h3>

<p>The traditional time span for goals is a year. At work, performance reviews are typically based on the goals that were set for the year. And then there are New Year’s Resolutions (no comment). In most scenarios I’ve come across, goals revolve around a year.</p>

<p>Maybe I just have a lot going on or I work in a space that moves quickly, but a year is too long. Ideas and technology move faster than a year and by the time I get 6 months in, there’s a new best practice, software update, or an unexpected roadblock that changes what I’m doing.</p>

<h3 id="3-stress"><a href="#3-stress"><span></span></a>3. Stress</h3>

<p>Goals are stress-inducing. And we now know that <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/kelly_mcgonigal_how_to_make_stress_your_friend">stress is a killer</a>. I don’t want my goals to kill me. That might be extreme, but you get my point. I want to hit my goals. “Write them down and they will come true!” I see this everywhere. Well, guess what? I wrote them down. I reviewed them daily. And all they did was make me worry about why I can’t keep up with them and wonder why I keep failing.</p>

<h3 id="4-vague"><a href="#4-vague"><span></span></a>4. Vague</h3>

<p>Because the time frame is typically too large on goals, I tend to make them as vague as possible. I intuitively realized that the circumstances would change and wrote them with a lot of flexibility in order to hit them.</p>

<p>But this poses another question: how do you know if you hit it or not? If it’s too vague to know whether you’ve hit your goal or not, what’s the point?</p>

<h2 id="creating-guides"><a href="#creating-guides"><span></span></a>Creating guides</h2>

<p>The yearly, monthly, and weekly goal cycle just wasn’t cutting it for me. Luckily, I ran across <a href="http://shawnblanc.net">Shawn Blanc’s</a> concept of three Most Important Goals each day. I’ve tweaked it for me, but the concept is to write down things that you want to achieve every day and not worry about the long-term. If you achieve these every day, you will naturally chip away at the long-term goal.</p>

<p>I really like Shawn’s approach, but I’ve taken to calling them my Daily Guides. As long as I hit these each day (or at least come close), then I will end up achieving those bigger goals without the stress involved.</p>

<p>Here’s what I came up with:</p>

<h3 id="personally"><a href="#personally"><span></span></a>Personally</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Read a book</li>
  <li>Write for others</li>
  <li>Learn something new</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="family"><a href="#family"><span></span></a>Family</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Encourage and serve my wife</li>
  <li>Spark an authentic conversation with my wife</li>
  <li>Spend time with my girls and give them my full attention (no phone)</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="work"><a href="#work"><span></span></a>Work</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Make progress on an important project</li>
  <li>Communicate with stakeholders</li>
  <li>Encourage my team and coworkers</li>
</ol>

<p>These are extremely flexible. I’ve found that if I miss one of these in a given day, I don’t worry about it as much. I know that I have tomorrow to pick it up again. I haven’t lost an entire year if I fail and I end up with a longer string of successes over failures.</p>

<h2 id="a-place-for-goals"><a href="#a-place-for-goals"><span></span></a>A place for goals</h2>

<p>I think goals <em>can</em> be good. They help us set direction. They show us our aspirations. And they’re good for communicating our intentions to others. But there’s something to be said for your state of being when you have goals in place. If it works for you, go for it! But if it stresses you out, know that it’s ok to give them up and put guides in place.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/My-OmniFocus-Home-Screen.jpg" /><p>With one of the recent releases of <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/omnifocus-2/id904071710?mt=8">OmniFocus for iOS</a>, we were given the ability to rearrange perspectives on the OmniFocus home screen. Of course, I geeked out on this and created a custom view. Here’s what it looks like.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="inbox"><a href="#inbox"><span></span></a>Inbox</h2>

<p>I keep my Inbox available as I often want to empty it. If I’m getting ready to focus on a project for a couple hours or just got off a call, I need to process things immediately so my pinball brain can go in a straight line for a while. Easy access to my inbox makes <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/getting-things-done-clarify/">clarification</a> easier.</p>

<h2 id="contexts"><a href="#contexts"><span></span></a>Contexts</h2>

<p>Here’s the obvious one. I need it to be easy to <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/gtd-contexts-proactive-vs-reactive/">choose a context</a> to work on. Most of the time, I’m using my phone to work through my <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/my-morning-routine/">morning routine</a>. At other times when I find myself on a plane or waiting for someone, I can use this as a way to find tasks to do.</p>

<h2 id="projects"><a href="#projects"><span></span></a>Projects</h2>

<p>I don’t go in here often, but it’s enough that I wanted it on the home screen. Weird, I know. There are instances when I want to look at a specific project and I’m away from my computer. It also just feels intuitive to have it there.</p>

<h2 id="dashboard"><a href="#dashboard"><span></span></a>Dashboard</h2>

<p>Here’s where I spend most of my time. This is a custom perspective that shows all of my Due or Flagged tasks. I decide on these the night before by going through my contexts and flagging the items that <em>need</em> to get done the next day. You can see a play-by-play of <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/a-chaotic-week-with-gtd/">how this works here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="nearby"><a href="#nearby"><span></span></a>Nearby</h2>

<p>I use this more than I thought I would. If I’m in a store of some kind, I’ll check this and look across all of my geotagged lists. It helps me figure out if there’s another errand I need to run while I’m out, like “buy ice cream.” Though I’m not sure why I don’t put <em>buy ice cream</em> on all of these lists. You can never be too careful with your ice cream supply.</p>

<h2 id="neutralize"><a href="#neutralize"><span></span></a>Neutralize</h2>

<p>This is another custom perspective that was inspired by Kourosh Dini at <a href="http://www.usingomnifocus.com">Using OmniFocus</a>. There are some tasks that need to be done repeatedly in order to keep your world stable. It can be little things like refill printer paper, clean the desk, water the plants, etc… I have these in a Single Actions list and use a custom perspective to make them easy to find. I try to clear this list every day.</p>

<h2 id="forecast"><a href="#forecast"><span></span></a>Forecast</h2>

<p>I don’t use this often because I don’t usually use due dates. But if I’m in a conversation with someone and they ask what I have going on in the next few days, this is one place I go to determine the answer. “What is Joe working on?” I don’t know, but I can find out.</p>

<h2 id="iphone"><a href="#iphone"><span></span></a>iPhone</h2>

<p>This is another custom perspective that I use frequently. It’s a combination of @Any Device and @Communicate. Those are the contexts I can work on from my iPhone. If I get through Dashboard and Neutralize, this is where I go when I’m on my phone.</p>

<p>PS. I keep this same setup on my iPad as well. I don’t want two different setups. But instead of iPhone I have one for iPad.</p>

<h2 id="review"><a href="#review"><span></span></a>Review</h2>

<p>I only use this on my phone when I’m traveling. If I see a number in the box, I’ll go into Review and look things over to keep me up to date.</p>

<h2 id="becky"><a href="#becky"><span></span></a>Becky</h2>

<p>This is a custom perspective that is based on a search for “Becky.” It’s really handy to go here right before I get off work to see if there’s anything I need to talk about or work on with my wife.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/A-chaotic-week-with-GTD.jpg" /><p>When I was getting started with GTD (Getting Things Done), I wondered what a week looked like for someone who used it. I never found anything along those lines and I recently had a week where I flexed it pretty hard. So I decided to give you a snapshot into my crazy week and see my GTD system in action.</p>

<h2 id="background"><a href="#background"><span></span></a>Background</h2>

<p>Last Spring our lower level family room had water in it. We had some hard rains and the water managed to work its way into the house. After many failed attempts to fix it from above ground, we decided to dig up a portion of the foundation to fix the root of the problem. This project was the main contributor to the chaos, but there were a few things that came up at work as well.</p>

<p>I often refer to my Dashboard throughout this article. It’s a custom perspective in OmniFocus. It consists of all my due and flagged tasks and it’s what I spend most of my day working through. You’ll see how I use it each day as we walk through my chaotic week.</p>

<p><img class="center-image" src="/assets/posts_extra/OmniFocus-Dashboard.png" /></p>

<h2 id="monday"><a href="#monday"><span></span></a>Monday</h2>

<p>I started off Monday by sleeping in a bit. I got up at 5:45 as opposed to <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/why-getting-up-early/">my normal 5 am</a>. I was coming off of a cold and wanted to make sure I had it beat.</p>

<p>I did my typical <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/my-morning-routine/">morning routine</a>. I got up and made breakfast, did my Bible reading, meditated for 10 minutes, did some writing, and then jumped into my <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/gaining-perspective-daily-review/">Daily Review</a>.</p>

<p>During my Daily Review I decided that after work I would mow the lawn, then start in on the foundation. I wanted to have the yard looking nice before I completely tore it apart. So I flagged those two tasks to add them to my Dashboard and deferred them until I was off work.</p>

<p>Once my review was done, I started my work for the day. The girls woke up around 8 am and I took a break until 9 to have breakfast with them. At 9, I jumped on a daily call that helps me get in sync with a couple coworkers.</p>

<p>Everything went according to plan on Monday. Work went smoothly. I had a couple small things come up, but I grabbed them from my email and added them to the appropriate projects and contexts. After work, I mowed the lawn and moved the rock mulch away from the house so I could start digging up the foundation.</p>

<p>Before I went to bed at 9:30 I did my typical <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/my-evening-routine/">evening routine</a>. Tomorrow I would move the hostas from around the house and start digging up the problem area of the foundation. Again, I flagged these two and deferred them until after work the next day. I also saw that I had expense reports due at work, so I set aside time for them.</p>

<h2 id="tuesday"><a href="#tuesday"><span></span></a>Tuesday</h2>

<p>Since I was going to start digging up the foundation that afternoon using only my trusty garden shovel, I slept in until 5:30. I knew what was coming.</p>

<p>The morning was normal and I kicked off my day without any issues. At 9 am, I did my sync-up call. On that call, we decided that some of the coding work I had been doing needed to be rethought and a majority of it needed to be redone.</p>

<p>After letting go of my frustration and admitting that it was a good decision, I wrote down what needed to happen and detailed the next actions I needed to take. I entered those into OmniFocus and deleted any tasks that no longer applied to the project. Then I resumed work on my Dashboard.</p>

<p>I managed to empty my Dashboard by late morning on Tuesday so I went to my list of contexts to start my next list. I was in the office so almost every context was available to me. That can be paralyzing, but I have them listed in order of importance so I started at the top.</p>

<p>As I was leaving my office at the end of the day I checked my Dashboard again and saw that I needed to move the hostas and start digging. So that’s what I did after work. The hostas went easily, but I reached a point of overwhelm when I started digging up the house. It was too much for me to do on my own.</p>

<p>I thought I was being a wuss so I grabbed <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/what-is-an-hpda-and-how-do-i-use-it/">my hPDA</a> and wrote down a couple friends to call if I needed help. I knew I wouldn’t add it to my system until my review the next day. I would wait and see how I was feeling in the morning before making my decision.</p>

<p>I set up my Dashboard for Wednesday that evening and went to bed around 9:30.</p>

<h2 id="wednesday"><a href="#wednesday"><span></span></a>Wednesday</h2>

<p>On Wednesday I was up at my normal time of 5 am. The morning routine was normal except that I spent 30 minutes running a shovel. It was during that time that I officially decided that I needed help. I wrote it down on my hPDA.</p>

<p>During my Daily Review, I threw out the card that had the names on it from Tuesday and didn’t even enter the newer task into OmniFocus. I texted a friend right away (he’s an early riser as well). He only asked what he needed to bring. I’m not sure what I would do without great friends.</p>

<p>The rest of my review was normal and I started working on my Dashboard until the girls woke up. It’s amazing what you can get done before the rest of the world is alive.</p>

<p>At work I had a few folks call me asking for help with either code or phone issues. I’m the resident Apple guru, so I get all of the iOS and Mac questions that aren’t easily fixed. That meant that I didn’t even get close to finishing my Dashboard for the day.</p>

<p>About 30 minutes before my work day was over, I quickly entered in some communication tasks based on the tasks remaining on my Dashboard. I had some coworkers that needed to know their stuff wouldn’t be done on time. Once I had dumped my brain of any emails and calls I needed to make, I pushed off the remaining Dashboard items to Thursday and worked through the list of emails and calls. Then I could stop work for the day and not have it running through my mind all evening.</p>

<p>My buddy showed up and we started digging. It went a lot faster with two of us. In one area we managed to get to the footing of the house, the hunk of concrete that the walls sit on. We discovered a big problem. There was no crack in the wall where I was expecting and there was no drain tile next to the footing. On top of that, the waterproof coating that is supposed to be on the foundation wall was basically non-existent.</p>

<p>I stared at it for about 10 minutes. Put in a drain tile or not? I already had it dug up so the time to put it in was now. I called a friend who knows this stuff better than me and he confirmed my thoughts. I had a <em>lot</em> more work to do.</p>

<p>Using my hPDA, I wrote down some of the high-level needs for the project and then kept digging. During my evening routine, I took those high-level needs and turned them into a list of materials needed and re-wrote most of the action steps for the project. Bed time came late at 9:50pm.</p>

<h2 id="thursday"><a href="#thursday"><span></span></a>Thursday</h2>

<p>The 5 am alarm was hard to swallow on Thursday. I was tired. But I got out of bed anyway. I made breakfast and my Dashboard showed that I needed to keep digging that morning. Part of the new plan involved the expansion of the current hole.</p>

<p>After 30 minutes of time behind the shovel, I went about my normal routine for the morning. The rest of the morning was pretty easy. I worked through my Dashboard all morning, but didn’t complete it. I grabbed lunch and then had a meeting early that afternoon.</p>

<p>I jumped on the call and was waiting for the key person to join so we could start. They never showed. That meeting was supposed to give me a big picture view for some of our future projects that I’m leading. Without that discussion, I couldn’t do any of the work I had planned for that afternoon and Friday.</p>

<p>The next 30 minutes was spent pushing off my long-term planning tasks and reviewing my projects for actions for that afternoon and the next day. Once I had re-adjusted, I went back to work on my Dashboard.</p>

<p>After work, my faithful friend came back to continue digging with me. Since we were expanding the hole, not digging a new one, it went pretty quick.</p>

<p>As soon as we were done with the digging, I checked my Dashboard and noticed that I had decided to call another buddy of mine about how to make all of this tile and drainage stuff work. I had completely forgotten about it. There was just too much going on. So I called him and he confirmed everything I had been thinking. At least I didn’t need to re-factor my plan… again.</p>

<p>At this point, my back really didn’t like me. I sat down to plan for the next day and I wasn’t sure I’d get back up again. But during my review, I decided to take a day off from the foundation work and recover. I needed to pick up a few more supplies and my in-laws were coming to visit so I wanted to take time for them as well. Bedtime came late again at about 10 pm.</p>

<h2 id="friday"><a href="#friday"><span></span></a>Friday</h2>

<p>Once again, I was up at 5 am. After my normal morning routine was completed I jumped into work for the day. I had a number of meetings and wanted to finish early so I could spend some time with my in-laws. I worked on my Dashboard and managed to complete it before the girls woke up around 8.</p>

<p>After second breakfast, my meetings started at 9. I had a 30 minute break at one point, but otherwise it was solid meetings until 12:30. I took a 30 minute lunch and then had another call at 1 pm. I was done with calls at 2, but had 7 pages of notes to process.</p>

<p>They were good meetings, but I wasn’t planning on that volume of paper to process afterwards. I ended up spending the remainder of my workday reflecting and processing notes from those meetings.</p>

<p>After work, I spent some time with my in-laws. My father-in-law was planning to help me with the foundation for a couple days so we were talking through everything that had been done already and what I was planning to do.</p>

<p>In the midst of that conversation, I realized that I was going to have to put in a new sump pump. But that meant a lot more work on the inside of the house - jackhammer a hole in the floor, dig out dirt, put in a sump basket, concrete around basket, and install the pump and piping.</p>

<p>That evening when I did my routine, I made the alterations to the project and put together the plan for Saturday. We would paint the rubber membrane on the wall and cut the hole for the new sump. It was a late one at 10:45 before I made it to bed.</p>

<h2 id="saturday"><a href="#saturday"><span></span></a>Saturday</h2>

<p>On Saturday morning I was up at 5 am. I did my morning routine and then loaded some materials I needed to return into the truck. By the time I had done all of that, the house was starting to wake up.</p>

<p>It was a busy day. We returned things in the morning and then painted on the rubber membrane. Before lunch we made a list of the materials we needed for the new sump pump and went to pick them up. When we got to the hardware store, my phone let me know that there were some other small things that I needed to get while I was there. Thanks, OmniFocus!</p>

<p>We came home, grabbed lunch, and then prepped the inside of the house for the new pump. While prepping, a couple things came up that we needed to get, so I added those to my system. The girls were going down for a nap so we stopped working on the house and went to rent the tools we needed to cut the hole in the concrete. The things I wrote down earlier popped up on my phone while we were out. I love that. Sometimes I add items to those lists just to watch it work. #nerd</p>

<p>When we got back, we took a short break and then the girls woke up from their nap. Time to jackhammer! It took a while, but we managed to cut the hole in the concrete and my mother-in-law returned the tools for us while we kept working. Yes, I trusted her with my debit card. Scary.</p>

<p>The sump basket then went into the hole and it was time to pour concrete around it to lock it in place and make it look nicer. We didn’t have enough rock to make it work. Back to the hardware store. We came back and finished up the concrete work.</p>

<p>That night I checked off a bunch of the items on my list for this project. I refer to my list as needed, but with a physical project like this I usually know what comes next. The list is to ensure I don’t forget something. I planned to finish installing the sump pump on Sunday. I don’t normally do work like that on a Sunday as I simply need a break at least once a week, but I had the help and wanted to take advantage of it. Bed time came around 9:30 that night.</p>

<h2 id="sunday"><a href="#sunday"><span></span></a>Sunday</h2>

<p>I was up at 5 am on Sunday. I did my normal morning routine, but added in a <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/getting-things-done-reflect/">Weekly Review</a>. I really needed to go through everything. It would help me reset and be ready for the week ahead. I knew there would be a number of things on my mind that I was unaware of so I decided to work through <a href="http://gettingthingsdone.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Mind_Sweep_Trigger_List.pdf">David Allen’s trigger list</a>. Sure enough, I added a bunch of tasks to OmniFocus.</p>

<p>The reflection time of my Weekly Review showed me that I had too much going on. I wasn’t prepared to drop projects so I moved 8 projects over to my Stalled folder to get them out of view. I review that folder once a week to see if I can pull any projects back into play.</p>

<p>We went to church that morning and afterwards we finished installing the new sump pump. I really appreciated having that completed. Everything else was mostly repetitive physical labor that needed to be done.</p>

<p>My in-laws left after the pump was installed. All we did that evening was play with the girls.</p>

<h2 id="take-aways"><a href="#take-aways"><span></span></a>Take-aways</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>It was crazy. Things were being completed and added so fast. But it was only stressful when I tried to use my mind to keep track of everything. When I realized that I had the system to rely on, I was relieved and could focus on doing each task well.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Doing my <a href="https://www.evernote.com/l/AAEbEpZT-g5L_Yj8N_HvYZ7ZLJFtNtiQAi4">evening journal</a> has to be really easy. I was able to get a read on myself by doing it, but I had too many questions to answer and I kept running through them just to be done.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Taking time in the evening to set up tomorrow’s tasks is invaluable. I love being able to get up and run.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Ask for help. We moved about 34,000 pounds of dirt - with garden shovels. I needed someone else there to throw dirt with me.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/Lost-in-Transition.jpg" /><p>I read a lot of articles about time management and how to “reclaim an hour a day!” Most of those seem unrealistic. But in an attempt to find more time I discovered a single area that needed a lot of improvement.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="transitions-can-be-time-suckers">Transitions can be time suckers</h2>

<p><a href="http://joebuhlig.com/working-the-focus-muscle/">Focus is a struggle</a> for me. When I have “free time” between tasks, it’s easy for me to fill it by checking Twitter or Instagram. I like to “just check” too much.</p>

<p>I decided to only check them 3 times a day. It’s a lot like <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/escaping-corporate-email-habit/">scheduling times for email</a>. I quickly found myself wondering what to do. If I wasn’t checking my phone, what could I do?</p>

<p>I was shocked when I realized this. I’ve never admitted to being “addicted” to my phone, but I couldn’t avoid the label if I was lost without it.</p>

<p>The volume of time that I had been wasting between things disturbed me. Every time I moved from one place to another or one task to another, I was checking my phone. And it wasn’t just a few seconds being lost, either.</p>

<p>I started using that time to think through things at work or plan ideas for the blog. I would use it to review a few projects in OmniFocus or do a quick brain dump. Those transition times became moments when I could do something meaningful.</p>

<h2 id="where-to-look">Where to look</h2>

<p>The time between tasks isn’t the only time to reclaim. When I started looking, I found a number of transitions stealing time from me:</p>

<h3 id="1--between-tasks">1.  Between tasks</h3>

<p>When you complete a task, how long does it take to make the decision to start the next one?</p>

<h3 id="2--between-contexts">2.  Between contexts</h3>

<p>When you <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/gtd-contexts-proactive-vs-reactive/">decide to change</a> your environment do you notice right away and start working on the next list or do you take your time switching?</p>

<h3 id="3--between-projects">3.  Between projects</h3>

<p>When you complete a project it’s good to take a break, but not too long of a break. It’s easy to delay starting the next thing.</p>

<h3 id="4--making-decisions">4.  Making decisions</h3>

<p>Sometimes it’s good to take your time deciding. In most cases, though, you need to trust your intuition and just make up your mind.</p>

<h3 id="5--waiting-periods">5.  Waiting periods</h3>

<p>Anytime you find yourself waiting on someone or something, can you do a quick task? It’s good to stop and smell the roses, but if you’re looking for time this is an easy place to find it.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-do-about-it">What to do about it</h2>

<p><a href="http://joebuhlig.com/getting-things-done-introduction/">Getting Things Done</a> is easily one of the best ways to handle this. The framework helps you make decisions up front so that you can quickly move to the next task, context, or project.</p>

<p>When making decisions, trust yourself. You usually have a gut feeling when you have to decide something. Start following that gut feeling and let it learn with you. You’ll start to make good decisions faster.</p>

<p>When waiting for things, decide up front if you’re going to do something or enjoy the moment. If you decide to stop for the moment, great! But don’t always reach for your phone. If you’re going to do something, use your <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/getting-started-task-management/">task management</a> system to help you make that decision faster.</p>

<p>And start looking for these times. It’s interesting how many transitions we go through in a single day. Cutting the time between things can give you a greater sense of accomplishment and help you find that magical hour a day you’ve been searching for.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/Working-the-Focus-Muscle.jpg" /><p>When I started writing for this blog, it was easy. It was new and shiny and I wanted to sit down in the mornings and write for it. Eleven months into it, it’s harder.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I still have a lot of ideas to write about (49 currently, according to OmniFocus), but staying on task when I sit down to write has become a challenge. The “new” has worn off and the motivation that comes with it is gone.</p>

<p>But I’m writing more than I ever have in my life.</p>

<p>I made a decision that I was going to stick with this one. I can easily go start a new thing. Staying focused on something for an extended amount of time isn’t one of my strengths.</p>

<h2 id="what-ive-learned-about-focus"><a href="#what-ive-learned-about-focus"><span></span></a>What I’ve learned about focus</h2>

<p>The brain is a muscle. Focus is <a href="https://blog.bufferapp.com/the-science-of-focus-and-how-to-improve-your-attention-span">controlled by your brain</a>. If you put a load on a muscle and let it recover, it will come back stronger. Focus works the same way.</p>

<p>The more you work at staying focused, the more you’ll be able to focus in the future. Your focus muscle gets stronger.</p>

<p>This is exactly what I did with my writing. I made sure that I had time every morning for writing. At first, I was only getting a few sentences down - I couldn’t stay on task much longer. Over time, I was able to finish a paragraph or two. And now I’m able to outline a post and write the majority of a first draft in a single morning.</p>

<h2 id="ways-to-flex-the-focus-muscle"><a href="#ways-to-flex-the-focus-muscle"><span></span></a>Ways to flex the focus muscle</h2>

<p>My journey of writing is one example within a specific arena. You could apply that method to anything you want to improve.</p>

<p>I did some research a while back and found that these three methods work well with increasing my ability to focus:</p>

<h3 id="1--meditation">1.  Meditation</h3>

<p>Every morning, I take 10 minutes to just sit. I try not to think - literally. The intent is to sit in silence and not think about what happened yesterday or what’s getting ready to happen today. It’s so hard to do this and most days I spend 8 out of those 10 minutes thinking about something. That’s ok. As long as I’m getting better at letting thoughts go, I’m good with it.</p>

<h3 id="2--hang-out-in-nature">2.  Hang out in nature</h3>

<p>Going for a walk through town doesn’t count. The intent here is to be in nature without having to pay attention to anything specific. It’s amazing how little your brain has to work to go for a walk through the woods or plant a garden. There’s so much to take in that your nagging thoughts tend to fade.</p>

<h3 id="3--set-a-timer">3.  Set a timer</h3>

<p>I don’t do this a lot, but it helps when I need it. There are days when I’m just tired and easily distracted. It’s those days that I use a timer. The timer is usually set for 30 minutes and the plan is to work on a single task or project until the timer goes off. After those 30 minutes I take a break and do whatever I want. It’s a lot easier to build focus when I know there’s playtime coming.</p>

<h2 id="taking-breaks"><a href="#taking-breaks"><span></span></a>Taking breaks</h2>

<p>Athletes take breaks in order to recover from a workout. You need to do the same thing with your brain. Runners can’t sprint for 4 hours straight. You need to make sure that you have time to let your mind wander and jump from thing to thing.</p>

<h2 id="areas-where-focus-matters"><a href="#areas-where-focus-matters"><span></span></a>Areas where focus matters</h2>

<h3 id="1--personal">1.  Personal</h3>

<p>You’ll always have things that you wish you did for yourself. Whether it’s reading a book, exercise, or even taking classes. In any of those cases, you need to stay focused on your goal as opposed to spending time on Facebook. Unless that’s your goal… (in which case you should read <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/the-internet-separation-layer/">this</a>)</p>

<h3 id="2--home">2.  Home</h3>

<p>I’m bad at this one. I love to start new projects around the house. But I’m terrible at finishing them before I start another. I need to focus on one or two projects at a time and stick with them until I’m done.</p>

<h3 id="3--business">3.  Business</h3>

<p>Similar to the home, businesses need to stay focused on the products and services that they want to deliver. Expanding too far and doing too much means a potential loss in quality to the customer.</p>

<h3 id="4--relationships">4.  Relationships</h3>

<p>We can only maintain so many relationships. Decide on the ones that matter to you and build into those. Focus on the friendships that build you up and that you enjoy. This doesn’t mean you can forgo all the others, but you can’t have a close friendship with everyone.</p>

<p>Focus is one of my biggest struggles. I love jumping from thing to thing and starting new projects. My goal is not perfection, but to keep pushing and building my focus muscle.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/Why-I-changed-my-newsletter-sign-up-process.jpg" /><p>If you’ve been to this site in the past, you probably saw the email sign-up form slide up in the bottom right-hand corner. If you’ve been here on a mobile device, you saw the sign-up bar across the bottom. They’re both gone.</p>

<p>As an online marketer, I know these methods work. Most of us can’t stand the popups that block our view of the content (evil mode). But sites continue to use them because they are awesome at increasing numbers of subscribers.</p>

<p>And it’s tempting. I like seeing my numbers rise like everyone else.</p>

<h2 id="the-purpose-of-the-newsletter">The purpose of the newsletter</h2>

<p>I want my newsletter to be a way of letting you know about a new article I’ve written and share quality content that I’ve found on the web. It’s also a way to start a conversation via email.</p>

<p>It’s a way for me to connect with you about topics that we both find interesting.</p>

<h2 id="what-it-means-for-you">What it means for you</h2>

<p>When I reflect on this purpose, I realize that driving up subscriber counts isn’t the point. It seems obvious now, but it’s hard to see when you’re trying to be heard. I’m after engagement and connection, not counts.</p>

<p>So what does that mean for the sign-up process?</p>

<p>It means I’ll stop nagging you about it. If you want to connect with me over quality content via email, you’re probably looking for a way to do so. You don’t need me asking you for an email address every time you want to read what I’ve written - that’s the opposite of connection.</p>

<p>I’ve had some great email conversations about articles on this blog via email. Not everyone agrees with my view but I appreciate the exchanges that our differences create. I’m glad that we can have an honest dialog about this stuff and work through it together. But it doesn’t make sense to be pushy about entering that dialog.</p>

<h2 id="how-it-has-changed">How it has changed</h2>

<p>I’ve made a lot of changes. The slide-in popup in the bottom-right is gone. The sign-up bar on a mobile device is gone. The sign-up in the top navigation bar is also gone. I even pulled the sign-up form from the footer of the page. Essentially, every sign-up form that could be perceived as intrusive has been removed.</p>

<p>However, I still want to have a newsletter that can start these genuine conversations. So I’ve added <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/newsletter/">a page for the newsletter</a>. If you want to be on the list, you can go there and sign up. That page is the only place you’ll find access to this list.</p>

<h2 id="an-apology">An apology</h2>

<p>I want to apologize if I’ve annoyed you in the past. I place a lot of value in websites that are clean and simple without being pushy. I haven’t followed my own advice on this and you’ve had to deal with it. I’m sorry for that.</p>

<p>Can we still be friends? ;)</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/Using-Omnifocus-for-Someday-Maybe-Lists.jpg" /><p>For a long time, I kept my active Next Actions in Omnifocus and my potential (someday/maybe) actions in Evernote. It worked, but it felt a bit cluttered so I moved it all into Omnifocus.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="why-keep-somedaymaybe-lists-in-omnifocus">Why keep someday/maybe lists in Omnifocus?</h2>

<p>The main reason I wanted someday/maybe lists in Omnifocus was the ease of activating them. It’s pretty common for me to pull items from these lists each week and spell out tasks for them. If they’re already in Omnifocus, it’s easy to change the project/context of the task or turn it into a project.</p>

<p>My secondary reason was to streamline the apps I used in my <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/getting-things-done-introduction/">GTD</a> setup. <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/omnifocus-setup-workflow/">Omnifocus</a> held all of my active tasks and projects while <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/evernote-setup-workflow/">Evernote</a> held my goals, someday/maybe lists, and reference materials. It worked, but it never felt smooth.</p>

<p>The altered setup brought my goals and someday/maybe lists into Omnifocus. The goals portion was simple, but the someday/maybes were more of a challenge. I prefer to collect these directly to their respective lists. As far as I know, there’s not a way to enter text (without entering a project/context) and have it auto-process into the right place in Omnifocus. So I made my own:</p>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works:</h2>

<p>In practice, here’s what I do:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Open <a href="http://agiletortoise.com/drafts/">Drafts</a> on my phone</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Type the item (and any notes about it)</p>

    <p><img src="/assets/posts_extra/Drafts_Typing.png" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Select the action for the appropriate list</p>

    <p><img src="/assets/posts_extra/Drafts_Actions.png" /></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Behind the scenes, here’s what happens:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The title of the draft and the body of the draft are appended to a pre-formed subject line of an email.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The email is sent to my <a href="https://support.omnigroup.com/omnifocus-mail-drop">Mail Drop email address</a> with the custom subject line.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The email is transformed into a task in Omnifocus and added to my inbox.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>An AppleScript that’s running in the background on my Mac finds the task in my inbox and parses it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The parsing procedure cleans up the title of the task and puts it in the correct place with the right metadata.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="the-setup">The Setup</h2>

<p>Requirements: Drafts app, Pro version of Omnifocus for Mac (you do not need the iOS app to make this work).</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>For each someday/maybe list, add a Drafts action that sends an email to your MailDrop address with the following format for the subject line:</p>

    <div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  --[[title]] @Context ::Project //[[body]]
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Open Script Editor on your Mac, and add the following AppleScript:</p>

    <noscript><pre>on idle
tell application &quot;OmniFocus&quot;
    tell front document
        set theInbox to every inbox task
        if theInbox is not equal to {} then
            repeat with n from 1 to length of theInbox
                set currentTask to item n of theInbox
                set taskName to name of currentTask
                if taskName starts with &quot;--&quot; then
                    set taskName to ((characters 3 thru -1 of taskName) as string)
                    set newTask to parse tasks into with transport text taskName with as single task
                    delete currentTask
                end if
            end repeat
        end if
    end tell
end tell
return 120
end idle</pre></noscript>
    <script src="https://gist.github.com/joebuhlig/c91ca9d5a47ab09d3525.js"> </script>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Save the AppleScript as an always open app.</p>

    <p><img src="/assets/posts_extra/Always_Open_Application.png" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Open the app and set it to open at login by right-clicking the app icon in the dock.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>

<p>This process could be used with IFTTT or any other system that sends an automated email. As long as you can get the formatted subject line into the email and send it to your MailDrop address, the script will handle it. I’m using Drafts to do this since it’s my main digital capture tool.</p>

<p>Here’s an example of the full syntax you can use in the subject line:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code> --Fix bathroom wiring! @After Hours ::House/Car - SA #friday #next monday $30 min //It’s driving me crazy.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This creates a flagged task named “Fix bathroom wiring” with the context of “After Hours and project of “House/Car - SA”. Its start date will be Friday with a due date of next Monday. The time estimate for it will be 30 minutes and the note will be “It’s driving me crazy.”</p>

<ul>
  <li>“–“ sets the name of the task.</li>
  <li>The “!” after the task name is what sets the flag.</li>
  <li>“@“ sets the context.</li>
  <li>“::” sets the project.</li>
  <li>The first “#” sets the defer date.</li>
  <li>The second “#” sets the due date. If only one “#” exists, Omnifocus assumes it’s a due date.</li>
  <li>“$” sets the time estimation.</li>
  <li>“//“ sets the note for the task.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="reviewing-the-somedaymaybe-lists">Reviewing the someday/maybe lists</h2>

<p>Since Omnifocus already has a Review process built in, these lists are easy to add. Select all of these lists and set the review period to every week and the review date as the next day you’ll do your <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/getting-things-done-reflect/">weekly review</a>. Each week when you take time for the weekly review, these will automatically be in the list of projects.</p>

<h2 id="activating-items">Activating items</h2>

<p>The best part about having someday/maybe lists in Omnifocus is the ease of activating items from them. When I review these lists and find a task I’d like to take on or need to complete soon, I can change the project/context that are assigned to it and it falls in place immediately.</p>

<p>This has been great for me. It’s removed the resistance I had to reviewing my someday/maybe lists and streamlined the process of acting on them when I decide to say “yes” to something. It also <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/getting-things-done-introduction/">frees my mind</a>. It’s one less app I need to look at when I’m trying to find a potential action item.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> If you’re interested, I have an update to the process I’m using for this that you can <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/omnifocus-auto-parser/">find here</a>.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/My-Evening-Routine.jpg" /><p>Much like a <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/my-morning-routine/">morning routine</a>, we all have an evening routine. Oftentimes, this means setting out clothes for tomorrow or getting the kids to bed. I do those as well, but I’ve also found satisfaction in reflecting on the day to put it into perspective.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="the-why">The “why”</h2>

<p>I think we all know why it’s important to pack your lunch and set out clothes for tomorrow. It makes the morning go smoothly. It’s a forward-looking action that preps you for the next day. But we’re typically bad at looking back on what already happened.</p>

<p>How do you know if the day was successful? Did you make progress on things that are important to you? Do you need to stop a habit or add a new one? This is why I take 5 minutes at night to review the day before I start the usual prep for tomorrow.</p>

<h2 id="winding-down">Winding Down</h2>

<p>Most nights, I work for about an hour after the kids have gone to bed at 7:30. I do my best not to start a task that will be too challenging as I know I won’t be able to turn it off. There is some risk involved with doing this (like the time I couldn’t fall asleep for 3 hours because I couldn’t stop thinking through an issue at work), but it seems to work well for me most of the time.</p>

<p>At about 8pm, I try to stop checking email. That’s my first step to winding down for the night. I’ll work for another 30 minutes, but I avoid any new inputs from others. At about 8:30, I start the following routine:</p>

<h2 id="the-routine">The Routine</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Daily Reflection</p>

    <p>The first thing I do is reflect on the day <a href="https://www.evernote.com/l/AAEbEpZT-g5L_Yj8N_HvYZ7ZLJFtNtiQAi4">using a template</a> in Evernote. (You can <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/evernote-setup-workflow/">see how I organize these writings here</a>). I have a <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/using-text-expander/">TextExpander</a> snippet that creates the questions for me as opposed to copying a note each time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Review Weekly Goals</p>

    <p>I set three goals each week based on my monthly goals. I won’t hit them if I don’t review them regularly and I want them in mind when I start the next step.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Plan Tomorrow’s Tasks</p>

    <p>I run through each of my contexts and flag items that <em>need</em> to be done tomorrow. I want this list as short as possible so I can get past the “treading water” stage and on to meeting bigger goals.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Clear to Neutral</p>

    <p>This is a term I stole <a href="http://www.asianefficiency.com/habits/clearing-to-neutral/">from Asian Efficiency</a>. The goal is to bring everything back to neutral. I clean off my desk, set out things for breakfast in the morning, set out clothes for the morning, and so on. The goal is to have everything ready to go for another day.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Read</p>

    <p>Once I’m set for tomorrow and have myself ready for bed, I read. It’s usually nonfiction and I’ll read for about 10-15 minutes before lights out.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="loose-ends">Loose Ends</h2>

<p>I try my best to avoid email after 8pm. I know I mentioned that earlier, but it’s crucial to my sleep. Email is good at gearing up my mind and that’s the last thing I want before bed.</p>

<p>When I travel for work, I find this routine is key. It helps me prepare for my meetings the next day and keeps me grounded.</p>

<p>Having this routine and following it every night tells my body that it’s time for bed. On a typical night, that means I’m asleep within 5-10 minutes.</p>

<h2 id="caveat">Caveat</h2>

<p>I said this in my morning routine article as well, but this routine is relaxed and fluid. I don’t worry about it if I miss a night or two. As long as I’m doing this most of the time, I’m happy. The next day doesn’t usually go as well when I miss it, but I’m ok with that. The point is to set myself up for a smooth day tomorrow. I don’t want to stress about an evening routine if I’m having a great conversation with my wife or we’re up late with friends.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/My-Morning-Routine.jpg" /><p>Everyone has a morning routine of some kind - even if it’s just “get up before the kids.” But I think it should be intentional and you can find yours by experimenting and learning what others do.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="the-why">The “why”</h2>

<p>If you have a morning routine, you know that the philosophical purpose behind it is to set you up for a good day. That’s great, but what does that mean? What do you need to do in order to set yourself up for a good day?</p>

<p>I have a good start to the day if I indulge in a couple things that I enjoy and accomplish a few tasks that help me achieve my personal goals. If I do these two things, I have the motivation to do the not-so-fun tasks throughout the rest of the day.</p>

<h2 id="getting-up">Getting Up</h2>

<p>My day <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/why-getting-up-early/">starts at 5am</a>. I know. I know. It’s super early. I get up that early for the quiet and to give some space for Joe to take care of himself. That’s how I see this time. It’s time for me to re-energize in order to be a better person for my family, at work, and in life.</p>

<p>On a typical morning, I will put on some old clothes for working in the wood shop or around the house. If we have people staying with us or I have an early meeting, I’ll go ahead and take a shower and get dressed for work at this time. I’m usually starting the following routine by about 5:15 and 5:30 respectively.</p>

<h2 id="the-routine">The Routine</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Breakfast/Bible Reading</p>

    <p>When I come downstairs, the first thing I do is put in some headphones and pull up the <a href="https://www.youversion.com">YouVersion</a> on my phone. I’m trying to read the Bible every year and I do so by listening to the audio version of a 365 day plan. I’ll listen to the reading while I make my normal breakfast - two eggs and a banana.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Meditation</p>

    <p>I’ve had people recommend this to me numerous times and I always shrugged it off as not important. I’m not sure why, but one day I decided to give it a try. I do my best to clear my mind and focus on the present moment for about ten minutes. It amazes me how hard it is to not think. That’s why I continue to meditate. It helps me work the self-control muscle of directing my thoughts and gain focus throughout the day. And I use the free version of <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/calm-meditate-sleep-relax/id571800810?mt=8">Calm</a> to help with background noise.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>@Before Hours</p>

    <p>I have a list in <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/omnifocus-setup-workflow/">Omnifocus</a> by this name. It’s specifically geared towards this time in the morning. I enjoy woodworking as one of my hobbies and this is the only time I take to create dust from hardwoods. When there are house projects that I’m trying to get done quickly, I’ll sometimes use this time to work on those as well. 30 minutes is about how long I’ll spend here.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Write</p>

    <p>I take about 30 minutes in the morning to write for myself or for this blog. Writing has been key to learning about myself and figuring out what I think about things in the world. If I want to form an opinion on something or understand something, I’ll take time in the morning to write about it. Sometimes that becomes a blog post and sometimes it ends up in my journal.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="loose-ends">Loose Ends</h2>

<p>I do my best to avoid work email until after I’ve completed my writing. If I don’t, my mind starts solving work problems but I’m not ready to start work yet.</p>

<p>I will check my personal email before I start working on my @Before Hours list. I like to think through my responses to those while woodworking.</p>

<p>I’m part of a men’s group at church that meets once a week at 6am. My morning routine is usually cut short on those days so I’ll either take a break from it for a day or continue when I get back.</p>

<p>I travel for work once in a while and the most important thing I can do while traveling is try to maintain this routine as much as possible. It’s especially important to start the day right at those times.</p>

<p>I start shutting down around 9pm. That’s when I start my evening routine and set up the next day. The early morning goes a lot smoother if everything is in place the night before.</p>

<h2 id="caveat">Caveat</h2>

<p>If you look through this article carefully, you’ll notice a lot of qualifiers in my sentences — “do my best,” “try,” “sometimes.” That’s because this is a relaxed and fluid routine. It’s ok if I miss something on a morning. It’s ok if one piece takes longer than I want and have to cut something else short. The point is to set myself up for a good day. It doesn’t make sense to start the day by stressing because I spent too much time in the wood shop. I just go with it and let it kickstart my day.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/GTD-Contexts-Proactive-vs-Reactive.jpg" /><p>I’ve always struggled with the contexts portion of GTD. I’ve tried tools, locations, energy levels, times of the day, mindsets, and on and on.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>My problem is knowing when to switch contexts. How do I know when to stop working on one context and pick up the next? I have to first notice that I’m in a new context and then make the switch. It <em>sounds</em> simple.</p>

<p>And it is simple if you can tell when you’ve switched contexts. But it’s challenging to notice that you’re in a new context when you use energy levels or mindsets as contexts. If you use tools and locations it’s a bit easier, but a tool based context is problematic when one tool can do most of your work and that tool is with you most of the time.</p>

<p>It starts to clear up when you think about having two different types of contexts - Reactive and Proactive. Stopping to think about how you use contexts in these categories makes it much easier to see the line between them and know when to switch.</p>

<h2 id="reactive-contexts">Reactive Contexts</h2>

<p>If we have a change of scenery or need to shut down a computer, we can easily see that something has changed. We are reacting to our environment. This is how the traditional view of tools and locations for contexts typically works. We look up and see that we are in the office or we have a piece of paper in front of us, so we work on @Office or @Paper respectively.</p>

<h2 id="proactive-contexts">Proactive Contexts</h2>

<p>Sometimes we need to put ourselves in certain state to work. This could mean a list for @Communicate or @Offline. In both cases, you need make a decision to open email, pick up the phone, or turn off the wifi. You’re deciding to do something and then switch to the context that applies.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>

<p>The problem that I have with Reactive Contexts is that I don’t just happen to find myself at a computer. I don’t just happen be in the office. I have to make a decision to turn on the computer or go to the office. Once I get there I’ll react to the change, but I proactively decided first.</p>

<p>So the question is this: <strong>do reactive contexts actually exist?</strong></p>

<p>I would venture to say no. At least, I haven’t been able to think of any that happen without me making a decision first. In every case, I’m deciding to change my environment based on the work that needs to be completed.</p>

<h2 id="what-should-contexts-be">What <em>should</em> contexts be?</h2>

<p>I will NOT say this is for everyone. I’ve seen a lot of GTD systems with radically different takes on contexts. And they work great for the people who use them. I want to pose a simple suggestion that takes little thought when deciding which context to work on.</p>

<p>I suggest going back to the basics of GTD and using tools and locations as contexts. Those should be the base while filling in with others as needed. For example, I use a single context for my writing - @Write.</p>

<p>If we use contexts that are obvious enough to require zero thought, you can easily determine what to work on. You don’t have to think much when your contexts are Mac, iPhone, and Office. However, you still need to decide to use each tool or go to that location.</p>

<h2 id="the-trick">The Trick</h2>

<p>A lot of people decide not to use these basic contexts because the tools are with us at all times. And that’s a fair point. I lived in that camp for a while. It’s taken time, but I’ve come full circle on these and finally figured out how to use them.</p>

<p>Each night, I look through all of the tasks available to me and pick the tasks that <em>need</em> to be done tomorrow. I call it my Dashboard. The Dashboard is not a list of what I <em>want</em> to do or feel like I <em>should</em> do. It’s a list of tasks that <em>need</em> to be completed tomorrow in order to help someone else keep moving. I keep this list as short as possible. Sometimes, it only has one thing on it and in one instance it was actually empty.</p>

<p>After completing my morning ritual and my daily review the next morning, I work through my Dashboard list. At this point, the contexts don’t really matter. They tell me what tool I need to grab to do the task.</p>

<p>When the Dashboard is empty, I either pull up a project that’s weighing on my mind and start working on it or I look at my context list and start at the top. Yes, I know. I’m not actually working by context at this point. That’s because the normal scenario of my work has every context available at once.</p>

<p>It starts to click for me when I’m not in my normal scenario - when I’m on a plane, driving, without wifi, or my phone dies. When these things happen, the number of contexts that I can work on shrinks and I can take it in stride and keep working. It’s when something is abnormal or broken that these contexts shine.</p>

<p>I love the simplicity of this. It stops my subconscious mind from constantly checking to see if I’ve changed contexts. It puts me in a mindset of doing tasks instead of wondering if I’m working on the right thing. It’s simple.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/Omnifocus-Hotspot.jpg" /><p>In our digital age, we tend to receive a large number of files via email. And we need to review these files or make changes to them. As an <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/omnifocus-setup-workflow/">Omnifocus user</a>, that means I need to create tasks out of these files.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I could invoke the quick entry dialog and drag the file into the notes field, but there are times when I have 10 files or more to do at once. That gets to be a lot of repetitive steps.</p>

<p>I started searching for a solution and came across <a href="http://www.asianefficiency.com/task-management/omnifocus-hotspot/">this post</a> by the guys at Asian Efficiency. It’s a simple process using <a href="http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php">Hazel</a> to turn a folder into a hotspot. This folder will <em>sense</em> that files are in it and add those files to Omnifocus automatically.</p>

<h2 id="the-set-up">The Set Up</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Create a dedicated folder</p>

    <p>You’ll need a folder to tie to the Hazel rule. I created one called “Omnifocus_Import.” Put it somewhere that’s easy to access. You might want to consider adding it as a favorite in Finder so it’s easy to access.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Add the new folder to Hazel</p>

    <p>Add your new folder to the list of folders in Hazel. As an alternative, you can download <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/wp-content/files/Omnifocus_Import.hazelrules">my folder and rule setup from here</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Create a new Hazel rule</p>

    <p>Here’s a view of what mine looks like:</p>

    <p><img class="center-image post-image-medium" src="/assets/posts_extra/Omnifocus-Hotspot.png" /></p>

    <p>I wanted the rule to automatically rename the file and move it to my Active folder, so I added those steps before the AppleScript, which is where the magic happens.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Add the AppleScript to the rule</p>

    <p>Click on Edit script for the AppleScript and enter the following:</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<noscript><pre>tell application &quot;Finder&quot; to set file_name to (name of theFile)
set theDate to current date
set theNote to &quot;Imported on:&quot; &amp; (theDate as string) &amp; &quot;

&quot;
set projectname to &quot;Test Project&quot;
 
set theTask to &quot;Review File: &quot; &amp; file_name
 
tell application &quot;OmniFocus&quot;
	set task_title to theTask
	tell default document
		set newTask to make new inbox task with properties {name:task_title}
		set note of newTask to theNote
		tell the note of newTask
			make new file attachment with properties {file name:theFile, embedded:false}
		end tell
	end tell
end tell</pre></noscript>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/joebuhlig/0e8a29e5f91ac9533f89.js"> </script>

<h2 id="using-the-system">Using the system</h2>

<p>It’s quite simple - just drag and drop the files to your new folder. You could also set up a keyboard command with Automator, Alfred, or Keyboard Maestro to make it even easier. Once you’ve added the files to your new hotspot, Hazel will rename the file, move it to the folder you selected, and add a task to Omnifocus. It’s simple and saves a fair amount of time when you have a lot of files to act on.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/Don't-Ignore-Push-Notifications.jpg" /><p>I was enjoying one of our first daddy-daughter dates. Of course, it was at a coffee shop. It was great! I drank my coffee and Cutie watched the constant movement of people between bites of her cookie.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>It didn’t bother Cutie, but it was driving me crazy. The lady behind us had something in her purse that would ding every minute or so. She did nothing! She just left it there. After about 15 minutes of this, her friend must have had enough as well. The friend asked if everything was ok. The lady finally pulled out her phone to check it and realized that her son was waiting on her at school. Her only comment as she was frantically leaving, “Why didn’t he text me earlier?!”</p>

<p>She was completely oblivious! You have a device in your purse that can notify you when someone or something needs your attention. What good does it do to have those notifications if you’re going to ignore them?</p>

<h2 id="ignore-one-and-they-lose-their-value">Ignore one and they lose their value</h2>

<p>If you have a device that can notify you in any way, you <em>have</em> to pay attention to it. You can’t check it later. It’s making noises and vibrating to get your focus. If you don’t comply and give it your focus, then there’s no point in it dinging and vibrating at all. It needs you to make a real-time decision. Do I need to act on this right now or not?</p>

<p>If you don’t act on the notification immediately, what happens? You postpone the decision and the action. Why would you postpone it? You might get too many of them or they’re not actually important. And if you postpone it, you’re saying it’s not important enough for you to look at it before making the decision. So now, you’ve devalued the notification and told yourself that they don’t matter.</p>

<h2 id="only-use-notifications-that-matter">Only use notifications that matter</h2>

<p>I’ve spent a decent amount of time pruning the notifications on my phone. When you think about it, how many things <em>need</em> your attention immediately? Is an email something that needs an immediate response? Wouldn’t they call if it was that important? And chances are that any social media notification can be turned off entirely. If something happens and someone needs you right now, wouldn’t they call or text you?</p>

<p>After a lot of time thinking about it, here are the four types of notifications I receive on my phone:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Phone Calls/FaceTime</li>
  <li>Text Messages</li>
  <li>Calendar reminders</li>
  <li>Omnifocus reminders</li>
</ol>

<p>What I’ve realized is that I need to check my phone when someone urgently needs me (phone calls/text), when I need to go somewhere or join a meeting (calendar), and when I’m due to complete a task (Omnifocus). These are the only times when something is urgent enough to warrant a notification.</p>

<p>Every time your devices make a sound, pay attention. Check it right away. If you’re in a meeting or scenario that trumps outside communication, turn on Do Not Disturb or Airplane Mode. The point is to make sure that you use notifications intentionally. Make a decision up front and pay attention.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/Siri-to-Omnifocus.jpg" /><p>I don’t have a daily commute but I still find myself in the car having ideas from time to time. I don’t want to lose those ideas, but I shouldn’t be typing into my phone or writing things while I’m driving.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I use <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/omnifocus-setup-workflow/">Omnifocus</a> as my list manager for <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/getting-things-done-introduction/">Getting Things Done</a>. Naturally, I want to collect things into the Omnifocus inbox as easily as possible. But when I’m in a situation where I can’t use my hands to write or type, I need to do it with my voice.</p>

<h2 id="the-setup">The Setup</h2>

<p>Thankfully, the team over at <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com">OmniGroup</a> figured out a way to dictate tasks into Omnifocus using Siri. Here’s how to set it up:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Create a new list in Reminders</p>

    <p>Open the Reminders app on your iPhone and tap on New List at the top. You can name your new list and also give it a color. I recommend naming it <em>Omnifocus</em>. This will make it easier to manage later.</p>

    <p><img class="center-image post-image-small" src="/assets/posts_extra/NewRemindersList.jpg" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Turn on Reminders Capture and choose your new list</p>

    <p>From the home screen of Omnifocus on your iPhone, swipe down and you’ll see a toolbar at the top. Tap on Settings and scroll down and go into the Reminders setting. Turn on Reminders Capture and select your newly created Reminders list from the options.</p>

    <p><img class="center-image post-image-small" src="/assets/posts_extra/RemindersCapture.jpg" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Invoke Siri and ask it to remind you of something</p>

    <p>That’s it! You’ve got it set up. Now you can invoke Siri and ask it to remind you to do something. Siri will add it to your list in Reminders and Omnifocus will pull the item from the list and add it to your inbox.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="tips-for-dictating-tasks">Tips for dictating tasks</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Choose your list</p>

    <p>If the new list you set up isn’t your default Reminders list, you’ll need to tell Siri where to add the item. “Siri, add… to my <yourlist>.” Otherwise, the item will end up on your default list and Omnifocus won’t be able to find it. You can change your default list from the Settings app of your iPhone.</yourlist></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Remind me to…”</p>

    <p>This is the most common version of dictation that I use with Siri. Since I have my default list selected in Omnifocus, I can simply say “Remind me to take out the trash” and “Take out the trash” ends up in my Omnifocus inbox.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Remind me to… at <date time="">”</date></p>

    <p>If you have a reminder with a due date, you can use this version. Siri will add an alert to the reminder and Omnifocus will translate that reminder into a due date for the task when it lands in your inbox.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Hey Siri…”</p>

    <p>I love this feature! Since I mostly use this when I’m driving and I typically use my iPhone for directions, I normally have my phone plugged into the car. When your iPhone is plugged in you can invoke Siri by simply saying “Hey Siri.” You don’t need to pick up the phone at all. Just start talking.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Note: This requires you to turn on the “Hey Siri” feature at Settings &gt; General &gt; Siri &gt; Allow “Hey Siri”.</p>

<p>Dictating tasks into Omnifocus has made life a lot easier when I’m traveling. I don’t have to worry about getting things off my mind when I’m driving. I can always speak it into Siri to make sure I don’t lose that amazing idea.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/The-Internet-Separation-Layer.jpg" /><p>We do it almost every day. We communicate with another person using a screen of some kind - social media, texts, emails, instant messages.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>The internet has made it possible to communicate in a lot of new ways. And since we have the internet in our pockets, we can connect with just about anyone at any time.</p>

<p>But are we starting to see issues with digital communications? I wouldn’t say there are flaws in the technology from a philosophical standpoint, but what if there are flaws in the way we use or perceive them?</p>

<h2 id="a-phone-call">A phone call</h2>

<p>I was recently on the phone with someone, talking about differences in the words people use on social media as opposed to the words they use when voice-to-voice or face-to-face. It’s amazing how someone can be rude and inconsiderate on Facebook and then be kind and caring as soon you get them on the phone. Is that really the same person?</p>

<p>During the conversation, I mentioned the separation issue of digital communications like social media. We are always one step removed from people and that can pollute the way we interact with them.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-separation-layer">What is the Separation Layer?</h2>

<p>Think about this way - there is a filter between you and them. It’s the nature of digital communication. The filter is nothing more than a delay in time combined with the inefficiencies of written words in conversation and lack of body language to aid in understanding.</p>

<p>This filter or separation leads us to a disconnect. We don’t immediately feel the gravity of the words we use and full understanding between us disappears. Yes, it’s possible to communicate effectively through these methods. But most of the time something is missed, even if it’s on a small scale.</p>

<p>If you add the expectations of the sender into the mix, it gets worse. If someone sends you a text message, when do they expect a response? Immediately. What if you’re in a meeting or driving? Without maturity, we’ll start to speculate the reasons why they aren’t responding and drama ensues.</p>

<h2 id="long-term-effects">Long-term effects</h2>

<p>In the long run, if we use digital communication only, we’ll begin to lose our true conversation skills. The skills of noticing <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/every-body-saying-book-review/">body language</a> and changes in voice to aid in understanding begin to disappear without practice.</p>

<p>It’s subtle, but a feeling of loneliness starts to set in as well. It feels like we’re connecting with people, but it’s not a true connection. We need the warmth of another person that comes from being present with them.</p>

<p>This separation layer can easily create a lot of drama. It happens a lot on social media. Something is hastily written and posted, which is then misunderstood by a friend. They respond in the moment with words that are again, misunderstood. Enter drama. And unfriending.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll_(Internet)">Trolls</a>. This is so easy to fall into when you add in the ability to remain anonymous. It becomes easy to send an online creator hateful words with no ramifications. We don’t see the creator and don’t feel the results of what’s been written. Again, we’re separated from the human on the other end.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-overcome-it">How to overcome it</h2>

<p>Given the prevalence of digital communication in our world today, this is tough. I work for a virtual company so it’s something I deal with on a large scale every day. Here’s what I’ve found to help combat the shortcomings:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Do as much in-person as possible.</p>

    <p>This goes without saying. If it’s something that has to be communicated in detail or you <em>need</em> it to come across correctly the first time, find time to meet in-person.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use video</p>

    <p>One form of digital communication that’s not far from real life is video-conferencing. There are a number of ways to do this. Pick one that works for you and use it as much as you can. Keep in mind that not everyone is comfortable with this so they’ll hesitate when you propose it. Don’t force it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pick up the phone</p>

    <p>If you’re having a disconnect with the other person over email, it’s probably best to pick up the phone and work through it. It’s faster, easier, and more effective to have 15 back and forth responses to each other over the phone than through email.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Repeat, repeat, repeat</p>

    <p>Sometimes you’re trying to convey just a small bit of information. It’s not worth the time to pick up the phone, turn on a camera, or meet in-person. Then what? Don’t leave it to just one communication. Reiterate the information in a few different ways and forms. Use multiple examples in your email, send multiple messages over a few days, and bring it up again when you’re on the phone with them.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The method you choose to ensure accurate communication is dependent on how complicated the idea is that you’re trying to convey and how important it is. If you’re intentional, you’ll be able to intuitively make that judgement call when you need.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/Saving-Full-Articles-in-Evernote-from-RSS.jpg" /><p>There is no shortage of articles on the web. Reading (or at least skimming) hundreds of articles can be done easily in less than an hour. But have you ever tried keeping a record of all those articles?</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I often remember reading an article about something and want to pull it back up. I used to spend a lot of time trying to track it down. Sometimes I found it, but most of the time it was lost. Eventually, that frustrated me enough to look for a solution. I started looking for a way to automatically save all the articles I read, and Evernote was my tool of choice.</p>

<h2 id="my-reading-tools-and-process">My Reading Tools and Process</h2>

<p>I use <a href="http://feedly.com">Feedly</a> for my initial article screening. I use it to subscribe to almost 100 blogs. Every day I skim the headlines of their RSS feeds and decide which ones I want to read - but I don’t actually <em>read</em> them in Feedly. Instead, I save them to <a href="http://getpocket.com">Pocket</a>.</p>

<p>Pocket is my “read it later” app of choice. It becomes a collection of the articles I want to read. Once I’ve read an article, I archive it. If I no longer want to read the article, I delete it.</p>

<h2 id="the-setup">The Setup</h2>

<p>You can use any RSS reader and any “read it later” service that is connected to <a href="https://ifttt.com">IFTTT</a> for this. You’ll also need a Gmail account. Here’s how to set it up:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Go to <a href="http://www.ukeeper.com">uKeeper</a> and enter your Gmail address along with your <a href="https://blog.evernote.com/blog/2014/06/14/inbox-hero-email-evernote/">Evernote email address</a>.</p>

    <p><img class="center-image" src="/assets/posts_extra/ukeeper.png" /></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Set up an <a href="https://ifttt.com/recipes/265750-send-full-articles-from-pocket-to-evernote">IFTTT recipe</a> to send an email to drops@ukeeper.com with the URL you want to save.</p>

    <p><a href="https://ifttt.com/view_embed_recipe/265750-send-full-articles-from-pocket-to-evernote" target="_blank" class="embed_recipe embed_recipe-l_42" id="embed_recipe-265750"><img src="https://ifttt.com/recipe_embed_img/265750" alt="IFTTT Recipe: Send Full Articles from Pocket to Evernote connects pocket to gmail" width="370px" style="max-width:100%" /></a><script async="" type="text/javascript" src="//ifttt.com/assets/embed_recipe.js"></script></p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Bonus: I also set up a Gmail filter to delete any message with drops@ukeeper.com in the “To” field. I read a lot of articles and didn’t want these emails cluttering up my account.</p>

<p><img class="center-image" src="/assets/posts_extra/gmail-filter.png" /></p>

<h2 id="using-the-setup">Using The Setup</h2>

<p>Here’s the process I go through when reading articles and saving them to Evernote:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>I pull all of my RSS feeds into Feedly and skim headlines on my iPhone.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I save articles to Pocket from Feedly by using their “Long Press To Save” feature.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I read articles in Pocket from any of my devices.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If I read the article, I archive it. If I don’t read it, I delete it.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>That’s it! Every time an article is archived in Pocket, the IFTTT recipe sends an email to uKeeper with the URL in the body. uKeeper takes the URL, grabs the full text of the article, and forwards that text to Evernote. All I have to do is archive the article… which I was already doing.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/Sloppy-Productivity.jpg" /><p>If you’ve read one article on this blog, you’ll know that I’m a productivity nut. But there’s a side to productivity that I haven’t seen mentioned very often - <em>life</em>.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Sometimes life takes over and you just have to deal with it. The systems are nice and if they’re simple you’ll use them to get through a tough time. But there will be days when the plan you put together isn’t even close to what you actually do.</p>

<h2 id="life-takes-over">Life takes over</h2>

<p>It’s been busy at work lately and I’ve been doing everything I can to keep up. I like to think that every request that comes in goes to my inbox and into the system. But if I’m honest, most of the requests I’m getting need to be completed yesterday. So I find myself working on them before they even make it to the inbox.</p>

<p>I have a <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/omnifocus-setup-workflow/">system of keeping lists</a> and <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/making-time-contexts/">scheduling time</a> to work on those lists. At the end of each day, I take a few minutes to put together my plan for tomorrow. But when things get crazy, I need to leave my day open and throw out the schedule. I leave things on the calendar and follow it if I can, but I’m not going to add more stress to the mix. I jump in and out of the schedule as needed.</p>

<h2 id="dont-forget-the-system">Don’t forget the system</h2>

<p>One thing I’ve been intentional about is keeping my system current. Even if I’m going to work on the request immediately, I try to add it to Omnifocus and then work on it. I can at least get the satisfaction of checking it off and I’ll have a record of what I did as well.</p>

<p>I’ve also made sure that when I have to forgo <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/making-time-contexts/">my scheduled contexts</a> I change my calendar to match what I actually did. This gives me the ability to do a post-mortem and look for ways to handle the crazy a little better in the future.</p>

<h2 id="its-ok-to-be-sloppy">It’s ok to be sloppy</h2>

<p>Try not to worry about things when they get out of hand. It’s ok. The point of the system is to give you something to fall back on. Don’t stress over it. Use it. Continue to trust it by keeping everything in it - even if you’re going to push everything else off and work on the thing you just received.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/Recurring-Checklists-in-Evernote.jpg" /><p>One of the first notes many Evernote users create is a checklist of some kind. It could be a grocery list, a to-do list for the day, or a morning routine.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>But what happens when it’s a list that you’ll use multiple times or at regular intervals? It might be a packing list for travel or a checklist for how to do something. You have a situation where you need to duplicate that checklist or reuse it.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>

<p>I wanted to keep <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/why-getting-up-early/">my morning routine</a> checklist in Evernote. I created my list of items and added checkboxes so I could be excited when seeing a bunch of marked off to-dos. It was great!</p>

<p>The first day was fine. I pulled up the list and worked through it without any issues. The second day posed a problem. I had already checked off the items on the list. I needed to duplicate the list so I could reuse it. But I didn’t want to introduce any manual steps to the process. I wanted to pull up Evernote and have it ready to go every time.</p>

<h2 id="attempted-solutions">Attempted Solutions</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Duplicate the note</p>

    <p>I could copy the note and uncheck all the items, but that was too many steps for a simple morning routine. And it would introduce manual steps.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use IFTTT</p>

    <p>I tried setting up an <a href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a> recipe that would create a new note in the night at like 3am. That meant the note would show up automatically without me doing anything. This would have worked, but it didn’t have a way to add the checkboxes. I really wanted the checkboxes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>TextExpander</p>

    <p>I explored the use of <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/using-text-expander/">TextExpander</a> to quickly add the items to a new note every morning. But again, that was a handful of steps to create the note, tag it, and then add the items to it. I wanted it to be there automatically.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Remove, then Add Checkboxes</p>

    <p>You can select the entire list and click the checkbox shortcut to remove all the checkboxes. If you click it again, it will add checkboxes to all of the items. The new checkboxes are unchecked. Great! But I’m really lazy. Again, I wanted it to happen automatically.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="my-solution">My Solution</h2>

<p>I finally landed on a ridiculously simple solution that worked for me while I was on a business trip. I had pulled up my packing list for traveling and checked everything off. I went on my trip. When I was packing up in the hotel to head home, I again pulled up my packing list. I was on my phone at the time so instead of duplicating the note or deleting/adding the checkboxes, I simply started unchecking the boxes as I packed things. When I was done, my packing list was ready for another trip. And I didn’t have to do anything!</p>

<p>Instead of trying to recreate the note or the checklist, I simply undid the work I did before. I started applying it to my other lists and found it really simple. And I don’t have to do anything! I can just use it.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/Instant-Gratification-vs-Instant-Perspective.jpg" /><p>I finished (second) breakfast and sat down at my computer to pull together analytics on one of my company’s websites. At that moment, a coworker texted me a question. I don’t remember what the question was about, but I do remember that it was almost an hour before I managed to get back to work.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>It’s amazing how quickly we can lose our focus. We can be deep into a project and three seconds later fall into a black hole of distraction that takes hours to overcome. What’s going on here and how do we avoid it?</p>

<h2 id="instant-gratification">Instant Gratification</h2>

<p>When you look at your to-do list for the day, there are most likely items on it that are both easy and hard. Some will take a long time to complete and others are quick. As people who enjoy checking things off, we like to do those quick and easy items. They give us an instant sense of accomplishment.</p>

<h2 id="instant-perspective">Instant Perspective</h2>

<p>If you’re like most, you’ve set New Year’s resolutions or goals for the year. However you do it, you know that there are important things you’ve decided to do. You know you should be doing the tasks that drive you closer to these goals regardless of their difficulty. But it’s hard to make this decision without putting your choice in perspective. Since these happen almost immediately and intuitively, we need a fast way to see our goals and priorities.</p>

<h2 id="the-setup">The Setup</h2>

<p>To decide quickly, I need a fast way to see the right information. In this case, the information I need is my list of goals and the prioritization of my <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/omnifocus-setup-workflow/">Areas of Responsibility</a>.</p>

<p>The Areas of Responsibility are easy since I use them as folders in Omnifocus. I can simply switch to Omnifocus to see what area trumps another by looking at their order from top to bottom.</p>

<p>I keep my <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/keeping-goals/">goals in Evernote</a>. Using saved searches and note links (<a href="http://joebuhlig.com/keeping-goals/">along with Alfred</a>), I can find the right information in a few seconds.</p>

<h2 id="how-it-helps">How it Helps</h2>

<p>Anytime you’re faced with a tough decision on what to do next or you sense the urge to do something just because it’s easy or fun, pull up the information you need to make an accurate decision. Don’t always do the task you want to do. Do the task you should do.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/What-Every-BODY-is-Saying-Book-Review.jpg" /><p>Have you ever had a <em>feeling</em> that someone is uncomfortable in a conversation? Were you able to point out the nonverbal cues that gave you that feeling?</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Nonverbal communication or “body language” is anything that allows us to communicate with someone without using words – facial expressions, shifting, stances, touches, etc… We see them every time we see another person, but we don’t always realize their importance.</p>

<p>Joe Navarro wrote <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/What-Every-BODY-Saying-Speed-Reading/dp/0061438294">What Every BODY Is Saying</a></em> to help us understand and notice these nonverbal cues. He was an FBI counterintelligence special agent for 25 years and conducted a lot of interrogations. He studied body language throughout his life and in his book shares stories from his career to help us understand the nuances and importance of nonverbal communication.</p>

<h2 id="nonverbals-and-our-limbic-brain">Nonverbals and Our Limbic Brain</h2>

<p>The brain controls everything we do, whether it’s conscious or subconscious. From folding your hands to painting a masterpiece, everything is controlled by the brain.</p>

<p>The limbic brain is the part of our brain that reacts instinctively to our circumstances. It is the limbic brain that causes us to jerk our hand away from a hot burner on the stove after we’ve touched it. The interesting part is that our limbic brain is also in charge of our emotions. Navarro puts it this way:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The limbic brain is also our emotional center. It is from there that signals go out to various other parts of the brain, which in turn orchestrate our behaviors as they relate to emotions or our survival. These behaviors can be observed and decoded as they manifest physically in our feet, torso, arms, hands, and faces. Since these reactions occur without thought, unlike words, they are genuine. Thus, the limbic brain is considered the “honest brain” when we think of nonverbals.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2>

<p>Navarro walks through each of the body parts and shows how to understand their movements (or lack of movement). He also helps us see that noticing nonverbal cues is not intended to help us manipulate people but understand them. Seeing that someone is uncomfortable in a conversation allows us to realize the need to change the topic or try to understand what’s going on.</p>

<p>Seeing excitement, concern, comfort, and stress in another person when communicating with them is invaluable. We can see when to back off in a conversation, when to ask more questions, or when to be quiet. Learning when to do each of these can deepen the connections between people.</p>

<h2 id="caution">Caution</h2>

<p>One thing that stands out in this book is the caution that comes along with seeing nonverbal cues. There are no definite “reads.” You always have to take body language in context with the conversation and other behaviors. A stress indicator can show itself when a lie is told, but also when the person is in a tough job interview. It’s an indicator of discomfort.</p>

<h2 id="detecting-deception">Detecting Deception</h2>

<p>Even Navarro, as a veteran FBI interrogator, tells us there are no definite “tells” that someone is lying. There’s a lot of wrong information out there about various behaviors that are bulletproof lie detectors. But the truth is there are no concrete gestures or actions that indicate deceit. You need to verify what you’re seeing multiple times and in different ways before you question the honesty of the words you’re hearing.</p>

<h2 id="how-its-affected-me">How It’s Affected Me</h2>

<p>Using Navarro’s easy methods, I’ve started noticing how people around me feel and what kind of mood they might be in. It’s a learning process, but in a short amount of time I’ve begun building more meaningful relationships with friends and family. I’ve even noticed a lot of my own behaviors and gained an insight into how I’m feeling in different situations. I highly recommend the book and look forward to rereading it in the future.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/My-Evernote-Setup-and-Workflow.jpg" /><p>Evernote is a handy tool with a <em>lot</em> of ways to use it – so many that it gets really hard to figure out how to set it up.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I’ve been an <a href="https://evernote.com">Evernote</a> member since April, 2008 and I currently have about 11,500 notes. That’s a lot to wrangle and I’ve tried to make a lot of setups work for me. About two years ago, I finally figured out that I’m a <em>tag</em> person and not a <em>notebook</em> person. That made it easier to put together the following setup:</p>

<h2 id="notebooks">Notebooks</h2>

<p>Similar to my <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/file-naming-disorganization/">file (dis)organization</a>, I’m only using two main notebooks in Evernote - <em>!nbox</em> and <em>NOTES</em>. <em>!nbox</em> is my default notebook and anything that isn’t automatically filed lands here for me to <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/getting-things-done-clarify/">process later</a>, (I use an exclamation point in place of the “I” to make sure it sorts to the top of the list). Everything else goes into a shared notebook for working with someone else or it goes into my <em>NOTES</em> notebook.</p>

<h2 id="stacks">Stacks</h2>

<p>Since I’m only using two main notebooks, Stacks would just get in the way. So I don’t use them.</p>

<h2 id="saved-searches">Saved Searches</h2>

<p>Evernote is great at searching your notes. There are a lot of tricks that you can use in the search bar, but I find that I’m pretty simple with the searches that I save. And I only save searches when I’m going to add them as a shortcut.</p>

<h2 id="shortcuts">Shortcuts</h2>

<p>These are a single-click way to get to a notebook, tag, or saved search. These sync to my iPhone and iPad to make all my devices identical.</p>

<p><img class="center-image" src="/assets/posts_extra/Evernote-Shortcuts.jpg" /></p>

<h2 id="tags">Tags</h2>

<p>I’ve found the ability to search and have multiple tags hard to argue with. It makes the entry and extraction of information really simple.</p>

<p>I should note that I use an “x” at the end of my tag names. You can read the “why” behind it <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/simple-trick-naming-tags/">here</a>.</p>

<p>I’m using two levels of tags – a parent level for easily finding the right tag, and the actual tags that I’m adding to the notes. My current parent tags are:</p>

<h3 id="areas-of-life">Areas of Life</h3>

<p>I don’t have all of them here, but these theoretically mimic the folders that I maintain <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/omnifocus-setup-workflow/">in Omnifocus</a>. I’ll often tag reference notes with a specific Area of Life to make it easier to separate later.</p>

<p><img class="center-image" src="/assets/posts_extra/Areas-of-Life.jpg" /></p>

<h3 id="collections">Collections</h3>

<p>These are groupings of things that I want or need to hold onto. They’re typically longer-term storage and “just in case” items.</p>

<p><img class="center-image" src="/assets/posts_extra/Collections.jpg" /></p>

<h3 id="drinks">Drinks</h3>

<p>This is similar to Collections, but specific to drinks that I enjoy. Whether it’s coffee or scotch, I’ll take a picture and some notes about it to review later.</p>

<p><img class="center-image" src="/assets/posts_extra/Drinks.jpg" /></p>

<h3 id="hobbies">Hobbies</h3>

<p>It’s really nice to have a place that I can capture reference material for my hobbies – articles, purchases, or even pictures of what I’m currently working on for that hobby. Again, this makes the segregation of notes easy later on.</p>

<p><img class="center-image" src="/assets/posts_extra/Hobbies.jpg" /></p>

<h3 id="information-trail">Information Trail</h3>

<p>I keep any confirmations, agreements, or other miscellaneous information that I receive when buying or selling something. Communications that are crucial to setting up new accounts go here as well.</p>

<p><img class="center-image" src="/assets/posts_extra/Information-Trail.jpg" /></p>

<h3 id="people">People</h3>

<p>Sometimes I have notes that are specific to a person. Having tags for these important people in my life makes it easy to pull up the notes that relate to them.</p>

<p><img class="center-image" src="/assets/posts_extra/People.jpg" /></p>

<h3 id="ratings">Ratings</h3>

<p>These are the ratings I use when reviewing products, like wines. This makes it easy to find things that we enjoy or need to stay away from when looking to make a purchase.</p>

<p><img class="center-image" src="/assets/posts_extra/Ratings.jpg" /></p>

<h3 id="social-media">Social Media</h3>

<p>These are tags for the social media sites I use. I’m automatically storing the updates I post to each so I can keep my own history of what I’ve put out on the web.</p>

<p><img class="center-image" src="/assets/posts_extra/Social-Media.jpg" /></p>

<h3 id="status">Status</h3>

<p>Sometimes notes have a few tags on them, but they also need to have a status that can change throughout the life of the note. <em>wipx</em> is a good example - “Work in Progress.” I use this one when I’m working on a note and it can be archived later by removing the <em>wipx</em> tag.</p>

<p><img class="center-image" src="/assets/posts_extra/Status.jpg" /></p>

<h3 id="things">Things</h3>

<p>I like to keep pictures and notes on the things we buy or thoughts we have for the house, car, computer, or anything else that seems like a good idea to store. It’s nice to know the size of your microwave light bulb when you remember you need one at the hardware store.</p>

<p><img class="center-image" src="/assets/posts_extra/Things.jpg" /></p>

<h3 id="time">Time</h3>

<p>These are used alongside other tags. They help me break out notes that are identical except for the content or title. Daily and weekly reflections, weekly reports, and annual goals would be a few examples.</p>

<p><img class="center-image" src="/assets/posts_extra/Time.jpg" /></p>

<h3 id="words">Words</h3>

<p>Anytime I’m writing for the blog or for myself in some form, I collect it in Evernote using one of these tags. This could be daily or weekly reflections, bible study notes, my weekly work report (15:5), or even book reviews.</p>

<p><img class="center-image" src="/assets/posts_extra/Words.jpg" /></p>

<h2 id="getting-things-into-evernote">Getting things into Evernote</h2>

<p>There are five main ways that I add notes to Evernote:</p>

<h3 id="manually">Manually</h3>

<p>The most basic way I get things into Evernote is by adding a new note and typing everything into it. I set up a keyboard shortcut (ctrl+option+cmd) with <a href="http://www.alfredapp.com">Alfred</a> to pull up a new note in a new window to make it easy to get things started.</p>

<h3 id="textexpander">TextExpander</h3>

<p>In most cases, I’m not entering everything into a new note manually. I’m typically <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/using-text-expander/">using TextExpander</a> to at least create an outline that I use repeatedly. Here’s a look at what I’m currently using for my daily reflection in the evening:</p>

<p><img class="center-image" src="/assets/posts_extra/Daily-Reflection.jpg" /></p>

<h3 id="email">Email</h3>

<p>Every Evernote user has a unique email address that allows them to email things into it. There are some tricks for auto-filing it into the right notebook with the right tags using the subject line, but I’m usually adding the unique address to the BCC line of an email to get an agenda or meeting notes into Evernote. I just let it go to my <em>!nbox</em> and file it later.</p>

<h3 id="drafts">Drafts</h3>

<p><a href="http://agiletortoise.com/drafts/">Drafts</a> is a sweet app for the iPhone that I use daily. I have actions set up to either append to current notes or create new notes depending on the action. It handles the filing for me automatically, but it allows me to get something off my mind and into Evernote very quickly. Lists of gift ideas, books to read, or even ideas for work can all be collected and stored in my running notes under the “runx” tag.</p>

<h3 id="ifttt">IFTTT</h3>

<p>If you haven’t heard of <a href="https://ifttt.com">IFTTT</a>, you need to check it out. I have a handful of “recipes” in IFTTT that automatically create new notes and file it away for me. This is mostly used for my social media archive.</p>

<h2 id="using-notes">Using notes</h2>

<p>With so much stored in Evernote, it’s hard to mention all of the ways that I use the information, but here are a few that I do on a daily basis:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Reviews - My <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/getting-things-done-reflect/">GTD Review</a> checklists that I reference daily, weekly, monthly, and annually.</li>
  <li><a href="http://joebuhlig.com/keeping-goals/">Goals</a> - I keep a list of annual, monthly, and weekly goals in Evernote and review them daily or weekly.</li>
  <li>Blog post ideas and writing - I keep a list of post ideas here and do my blog writing in Evernote.</li>
  <li>Meeting agendas - I take all of the meeting agendas that are applicable to the day and store them here. I’ll sometimes take notes on top of the agenda, but normally just use it for reference.</li>
  <li>As needed - There are a number of times in a day that I will pull up Evernote and do a quick search for something.</li>
</ol>

<p>When I first started with Evernote, I did a lot of searching for articles that would help me understand how to use it. And there are a lot of them out there. Reading a bunch of these articles and picking pieces from them is a great way to find the system that works for you.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/The-Danger-of-Infinity-Apps.jpg" /><p>An <em>infinity</em> app is one with a never-ending stream of some kind. It’s an app that always has new updates for you to consume.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>If you have a smartphone, there’s a good chance that you use at least a few of these. Almost every social media and video network has a streaming feed. It’s great! There’s a continuous stream of information that you can learn about, making it really easy to find new content. So what’s the problem?</p>

<h2 id="time">Time</h2>

<p>When are you done? How do you know when you’ve read everything that you need to read? You can spend an endless amount of time with these apps because you’ll never reach the end. There’s always more that you can do on them.</p>

<h2 id="comparing-yourself">Comparing yourself</h2>

<p>Typically, these apps are choosing which updates to show you. And they’re usually the most popular updates. But in most cases that means it’s something extreme - vacation photos, a new mom with hair in order, a killer swordfish dinner, or the adorable new puppy. The more we see those extraordinary updates, the more we wonder if that’s the norm. If that’s the norm, am I normal? You see where this goes — am I good enough?</p>

<h2 id="what-to-do">What to do</h2>

<p>There are a couple things you can do to avoid the comparison and time-suck of these apps. The first is easy — delete it. Then you’ll never have to deal with it again. But more often than not, you’d rather have it stick around. If that’s the case, I’d recommend setting time limits (5 or 10 minutes?) on these apps or even scheduling your time with them (once or twice a day?). Put a limit on it. Don’t let the hours of time disappear without something to bring you back to reality.</p>

<p>And when you <em>are</em> using these apps, be aware of the “cherry picking” that goes on. Know that those are the best times and that life happens. When the camera is off, life goes on and it’s not always as good (or bad) as you saw.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/Keeping-Up-with-Your-Goals.jpg" /><p>It’s resolution time! Or not. There are a plethora of articles telling you to set goals as opposed to resolutions. The term doesn’t really matter. They’ll fail without a plan behind them.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Having a system for keeping goals in mind and yourself on track is what’s important. You need three things to do this: your goals, actions for reaching those goals, and a regular review of both.</p>

<h2 id="a-list-of-goals">A list of goals</h2>

<p>I keep my list of goals in Evernote. Each goal gets a separate note with the goal as the title of the note. Any motivation or reasoning behind it goes into the body of the note.</p>

<p><img class="center-image" src="/assets/posts_extra/Evernote-Goal-Note.jpg" /></p>

<p>The key here is to create a separate “index” note. It’s as simple as making a new note with links to each of the individual goal notes. This way you can see them all at once and easily jump to each one.</p>

<p><img class="center-image" src="/assets/posts_extra/Goal-Index-Note.jpg" /></p>

<h2 id="next-actions">Next Actions</h2>

<p>I set up a project in <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/omnifocus-setup-workflow/">Omnifocus</a> for each goal. The idea is to put my time where my head is. I want to achieve something so I better decide what I need to do in order to accomplish it. Those actions go here.</p>

<p><img class="center-image" src="/assets/posts_extra/Omnifocus-Goal-Project.jpg" /></p>

<p>In the notes section for each project, I add the link back to the Evernote note for that specific goal. This makes it easy to jump over and look at the motivation behind the goal and get clarity when I need it.</p>

<p><img class="center-image" src="/assets/posts_extra/Omnifocus-Note-Link.jpg" /></p>

<h2 id="reviewing-your-goals">Reviewing your goals</h2>

<p>It’s nice to set goals or resolutions and it’s great to define the tasks you need to complete them, but unless you’re reviewing your goals regularly you’ll forget why you’re doing anything at all.</p>

<p>I look over my goal index note in Evernote every day and I read the motivation behind each goal weekly during my [Weekly Review]. During my Weekly Review I make sure that I have actions each week that will count towards each of my goals. If I do that, I know I’m chipping away at all of them.</p>

<h2 id="pro-tip">Pro Tip</h2>

<p>Something that I’ve found helpful is having a quick way to look at my list of goals. I do this using a workflow in <a href="http://www.alfredapp.com">Alfred</a>. I invoke Alfred and type “goal,” which opens my goal index note in Evernote for immediate review.</p>

<p>I do this because I’m asked to take on new projects almost daily. Most of the time I know the answer. But there are times when I don’t know if it will help me achieve my goals or not. This is when it’s really nice to quickly pull them up and double-check.</p>

<p>It’s a simple setup. Set your goals, determine actions, and review it all. The rest of the system is there to make it easier to accomplish your goals.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/What-is-an-Inbox.jpg" /><p>An inbox can be your mailbox, your email inbox, and even a physical tray. But those aren’t the only places that stuff lands.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I’m not going into the reasons why you need to empty inboxes, but let me say it’s really important. If you don’t empty them, you risk letting something slide that you should have dealt with.</p>

<p>The real question is this – Have you identified all of your inboxes? It sounds simple, but I keep finding more of them. Here are some examples of inboxes I’ve discovered:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Mailbox</p>

    <p>The easy one. It’s at the end of your driveway and you check it once a day.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Email</p>

    <p>Another easy one. We’re all familiar with our email inbox.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Paper</p>

    <p>You accumulate paper from taking notes, handouts, mail, or even your kids’ artwork. Hopefully you have a place to collect these.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apps</p>

    <p>Some apps have their own version of an inbox built into them. Evernote has a default notebook that notes are added to. Omnifocus has an inbox for collecting actions to be processed later.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Social Media</p>

    <p>If you participate in any social site you have a feed of information from friends and relatives. You probably don’t need to <em>do</em> anything about each post but you’ll at least learn what’s going on in their lives. The trick here is knowing when this inbox is empty.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Notification Center</p>

    <p>The accumulated notification list on your phone is a place that’s full of things you need to deal with. The question is this – Should you be allowing apps to automatically add things to your inbox?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apps with Badges</p>

    <p>Similar to the notification center, you’ll have apps that show badges on your phone. Those are just screaming for you to check them and make decisions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your house</p>

    <p>The entire house can be an inbox. If there’s something on the floor or out of place, you have a decision to make – should you pick it up and put it away or leave it? If you leave it, it’s the same as leaving emails in your inbox. At some point, you’ll need to do something about it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Piles</p>

    <p>I’m terrible at this. I’ll create piles in random places to deal with later. As an example, I recently realized that I pile stuff on our trash can just outside the garage door. The intent is that I’ll take that pile to the woodshop the next time I’m out there. (We won’t talk about how often that actually works.)</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>It’s interesting how you’ll find inboxes that you’ve unknowingly been using or that have been sitting. They’re just waiting for you to do something.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/Making-Time-for-Contexts.jpg" /><p>The difficult part of <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/getting-things-done-introduction/">Getting Things Done</a> (GTD) for me is contexts. What lists should I be using when I’m completing tasks?</p>

<!--more-->

<p>It’s a question that a lot of people have asked. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Things-Done-Stress-Free-Productivity/dp/0142000280">The book</a> mentions things like Calls, Computer, Errands, Office, and Home as suggested contexts. But I <em>always</em> have a phone with me. So I can <em>always</em> make phone calls. I work from home. So Office and Home are one and the same. My phone is a computer. So I <em>always</em> have a computer on me.</p>

<p>I’ve tried a number of different concepts with contexts. I wanted something that made sense in our world today. With so many tools accessible at all times, I needed an easy way to break out my actions. Here are my failed attempts:</p>

<h3 id="tools">Tools</h3>

<p>I originally tried listing actions by the tool it took to complete them – Laptop, iPad, Phone, Whiteboard. But I had to pick a tool to use for an action and many times had multiple tools in front of me at a time.</p>

<h3 id="applications">Applications</h3>

<p>This seemed logical. Since a large portion of my work is on the computer, I made lists for the apps that I would use to do the task – Excel, SQL Server, Outlook. But I could easily launch any and all of them whenever I wanted.</p>

<h3 id="locations">Locations</h3>

<p>I was excited about this one at first. Everything is based on where I am – Home, Work, Woodshop, Church. But I quickly realized that the lists for Home and Work could get long. It was depressing to see a list so long and I couldn’t decide what to work on.</p>

<h3 id="energy-levels">Energy Levels</h3>

<p>Now we’re getting somewhere. Break out your tasks based on how much energy you have – Low, Normal, High. I really wanted this to work. But the line between each was blurred. It’s hard to tell when I’m transitioning between Low and Normal or Normal and High.</p>

<h3 id="timeenergy-combination">Time/Energy Combination</h3>

<p>I stole this one from Sven Fechner at <a href="http://simplicitybliss.com/a-fresh-take-on-contexts">Simplicity Bliss</a>. They are a combination of how much energy and time you have for the task – Short Dashes, Full Focus, Brain Dead. I like how Sven uses Omnifocus so I spent a lot of time trying to make this one work. But again, I struggled to see the lines between one context and the next. I could never see when to switch contexts.</p>

<h3 id="periods-in-the-day">Periods in the Day</h3>

<p>This one actually worked for a while. I had lists for the time of the day – Morning, Hours (when I was working), After Hours, Evening. But the lists were too long for me. I had a hard time deciding what to do with 30+ items on each list. I need more granularity than that.</p>

<h2 id="the-overarching-problems">The Overarching Problems</h2>

<p>Here’s what I learned throughout my experiments.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Tools are ubiquitous.</p>

    <p>With computers in our pockets, it’s too easy to pull them out and work from anywhere at any time. I need something that is tool agnostic.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I can’t sense energy levels.</p>

    <p>As much as I pay attention to the amount of energy I have at a time, I still can’t decide when I’ve switched. I need a hard line for contexts as opposed to a judgement call.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reactive contexts don’t work.</p>

    <p>Most of these contexts were reactive, meaning you switch to a context when you realize you are in it. Ex: You pull up your Calls list when you have a phone in front of you. I need to use proactive contexts. I need to <em>put myself</em> in a context.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="using-verbs-as-contexts">Using Verbs as Contexts</h2>

<p>After a couple hours with a whiteboard I realized I like to see my tasks by the type of action needed to complete it. What verb do I need to do in order to check it off? My new contexts are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Communicate - calls, emails, social media replies, text messages.</li>
  <li>Create - writing code, creating presentations, making documents.</li>
  <li>Write - long form writing.</li>
  <li>Think - planning, brainstorming, and problem-solving tasks.</li>
  <li>Learn - things to Google or that I’m curious about – I used to call this my Distractions list.</li>
  <li>Read - books, articles, or documents I need to read or review.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once I had these determined, I noticed two things. One, I really like seeing my tasks broken out by these verbs. Two, I had no idea how I would know when to switch from one context to the next.</p>

<h2 id="the-hard-question">The Hard Question</h2>

<p>I was listening to <a href="http://5by5.tv/mikesonmics/130">a Workflowing podcast</a> where <a href="http://patrickrhone.com">Patrick Rhone</a> posed an interesting question, “If not now, when?” Patrick later <a href="http://patrickrhone.com/2014/11/11/a-time-for-things/">wrote about it</a> on his blog.</p>

<p>The premise of the question is this: if it’s important enough that you’ve decided to do it, when are you going to do it?</p>

<h2 id="tying-it-together">Tying It Together</h2>

<p>After listening to the podcast and reading the article, I wondered if that was the missing piece to this whole thing. I had my lists, but I have always struggled with knowing when to work on which list. What if I scheduled time for each list?</p>

<p>This might be why the <em>Periods in the Day</em> idea almost worked. If I know what time of day I work on each list, I’ll proactively go to that list and work on it. Simple.</p>

<p>With my new verb approach, I had created a perfect setup for this. I knew I liked writing in the late morning, why not put my Write list on the calendar for late morning? I then took it one step further and created a schedule for the week where I put every context on the calendar.</p>

<p>It took some tweaking, but I eventually determined the best time of day for each verb. I write in the late morning and do my thinking right before lunch. I do some learning right after lunch. As long as I stick to the schedule, I know that I’m in the right mindset at each time for the tasks I’m taking on.</p>

<h2 id="always-evolving">Always Evolving</h2>

<p>Our contexts do change over time and that’s ok. The type of tasks we’re doing will change over time and our stage of life will also change. The nature of living dictates that the lists we work on will change. Don’t be afraid to tweak them, but also make sure that you give them time before you change them again.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/Productivity-vs-Presence.jpg" /><p>We are taught to accomplish tasks. In school and work, grades and reviews measure our ability to accurately complete an assignment.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>The question is – were you present during the task or looking forward to its completion? Did you make plans for what you would do afterwards or take in the details of the experience? Were you just being <em>productive</em> or were you being <em>present</em> during the activity?</p>

<p>This isn’t easy to wrestle with and I’m terrible at it. I struggle with it on a daily (if not hourly) basis. I want to get a lot done in a day, but I also want to enjoy the time I spend doing it.</p>

<h2 id="being-present">Being present</h2>

<p>Vacations are the worst. The idea is to take a break and re-energize. But I find myself focusing on the outcome of what I’m doing. I’m focused on getting to my destination instead of enjoying the trip. Or I want to get through lunch so I can start something else. I’m still trying to check things off even when I’m “taking a break.”</p>

<p>I should be enjoying lunch and not devouring it. I can do the thing <em>and</em> enjoy the process of doing the thing. It’s ok. It might take a bit longer, but that’s the point. Savor the time.</p>

<h2 id="being-productive">Being productive</h2>

<p>I can’t always take more time to do things. I have work to do and work that I love doing. If I were to slow it all down, I would become frustrated with myself for falling behind. Not to mention my employer would need to have a chat with me.</p>

<p>And there are instances when we don’t have time to slow down. I have a meeting at noon and sat down to lunch at 11:45. Taking my time to savor lunch over 30 minutes isn’t an option.</p>

<h2 id="productivity-presence-tension">Productivity-Presence Tension</h2>

<p>The line between productivity and presence is like the work-life tension we all battle. Let’s define work as “accomplishing tasks” and life as “enjoying moments.” I’m not saying you can’t complete a task and enjoy the process. But are you focused on doing it or enjoying it?</p>

<p>It’s a tension. It’s not a black and white balance. It’s a struggle that we need to be aware of and grapple with daily. Do I need to be productive or present in this moment?</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/GTD-A-Day-in-the-Life.jpg" /><p>There are a lot of articles about setting up GTD. But I don’t see many that show what a typical day looks like when you adopt the framework.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>So let me walk you through a normal day with Joe. You’ll quickly see that I lead a very structured life. It’s intentional and not for everyone. I do that to give me more creative space in the day. I know that sounds counter-intuitive, but the structure frees my mind to focus on now and not worry about what comes next.</p>

<h2 id="starting-the-day">Starting the Day</h2>

<p>My day <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/why-getting-up-early/">starts at 5am</a>. I eat breakfast, read my Bible, and then spend some time in the wood shop (working on my @woodshop list) or catching up on articles.</p>

<p>Once I’ve done my morning routine, I run through my <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/gaining-perspective-daily-review/">Daily Review</a>. I like to empty all my inboxes at this point and make sure I know what I’m planning to do for the day.</p>

<p>After the Daily Review, I start working on my <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/choosing-3-important-tasks-day/">3 Most Important Tasks (MITs) for the day</a> and usually have these completed by the time my wife and daughter wake up.</p>

<p>While I’m getting Cutie ready for the day and making her breakfast, (and my second breakfast), I tend to have ideas running through my mind. I try to jot them down on <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/what-is-an-hpda-and-how-do-i-use-it/">my hPDA</a> so I can stop thinking about them and enjoy my time with Cutie.</p>

<p>After second breakfast I grab a shower and then “go to work.” I put that in quotes since all I do is go to the family room and turn on a computer. I’ve also been working for at least an hour or more already.</p>

<h2 id="accomplishing-tasks">Accomplishing Tasks</h2>

<p>95% of the work I do is on the computer or in my head. Because of that, my contexts don’t revolve around tools, but verbs. Read/Review, Write, Think, Learn, and Create would be examples.</p>

<p>There are times in the day when my energy levels and attention are best suited for each of these, so I put them on my calendar accordingly. For example, I do my best thinking right before lunch and enjoy learning right after lunch. I schedule each list for the best time.</p>

<p>This makes it super easy for me to work through the day. I see a calendar notification on the computer or my phone that indicates the context I need to shift into and switch to that <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/omnifocus-setup-workflow/">list in Omnifocus</a> where I’ll <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/getting-things-done-engage/">decide which task</a> to work on. Throughout the day, I’ll have meetings, phone calls, text messages, and IMs that I work around, but the majority is spent working through different lists at different times.</p>

<h2 id="dealing-with-email">Dealing with Email</h2>

<p>I’ve written about <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/escaping-corporate-email-habit/">my email habit before</a>, but the short version is that I only check my email twice a day. I don’t let the constant emailing distract me from the real work I’m doing.</p>

<p>If things get busy or I have a fast moving project, I’ll add a third email check into my day. But every time I open my email, I’m working towards an empty inbox by either archiving, deleting, adding a task to Omnifocus, or clipping it to Evernote as reference material.</p>

<h2 id="handling-meetings">Handling Meetings</h2>

<p>Meetings can be a great way to collaborate and reach decisions. But you need to make sure that you’ve planned for them and can handle the influx of “stuff” that comes out of them. Because I check my calendar during my Daily Review, I’ve seen the upcoming meetings for the day and plan appropriately for them.</p>

<p>I take a lot of notes using the <a href="http://patrickrhone.com/dashplus/">Dash-Plus system</a> and process each line right after the meeting. Each item on the paper goes either to Evernote or Omnifocus. Then I take a picture of the paper with the Evernote document scanner and throw it away.</p>

<p>Sometimes I’ll have meetings requested the day-of and have to readjust last minute. Although it’s frustrating to have those come up, they are sometimes necessary. Because my calendar is up-to-date, I can easily push things off or reject the meeting invite depending on the urgency and importance of the request.</p>

<h2 id="phone-calls-text-messages-and-im">Phone Calls, Text Messages, and IM</h2>

<p>These are unexpected communications in one form or another. The key is to set aside my current work and handle it. That usually means grabbing a piece of paper to collect the actions and reference items that I process later. Depending on the urgency of the new items, I’ll either adjust my day or toss it in my inbox to be processed tomorrow morning.</p>

<h2 id="ending-the-day">Ending the Day</h2>

<p>I mentioned earlier in this article that I work on <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/choosing-3-important-tasks-day/">my 3 MITs</a> in the morning. I choose those the night before so I can get up and go quickly in the morning. I pick them by reviewing my calendar and my goals for the week. I can see what’s coming up, what I’m working towards this week, and plan the next day. This is the one of the last things I do before going to bed at night.</p>

<h2 id="weekly-review">Weekly Review</h2>

<p>Every Sunday morning, I take the time I would normally spend on MITs to review my whole system. Every action list, Someday/Maybe list, upcoming calendar, previous calendar, and project gets a look. I see if I’ve accomplished my goals for the week and choose three goals for the next week.</p>

<p>I look at my action lists and see what my workload looks like for the next week. I try to be honest with myself by choosing only the items that I want to complete this week. I push off anything that I don’t have time for or isn’t urgent… yet.</p>

<p>The biggest advantage that I see with GTD is the ability to look at all events and actions that I have going on for the day and know what I can push off or work on depending on the energy and urgency of the day. It frees me up to focus on the task and not worry about it being the right task. I can have a “mind like water” and let my creativity roam.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/GTD-Engage.jpg" /><p>Deciding what to work on can be simple – it doesn’t have to be stressful. GTD can help you make the decision quickly and easily.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Once you have the whole system in place and reviewed, you can step into the purpose of the framework - accomplishing tasks. Choose a task that moves you closer to your goals, complete it, and repeat.</p>

<p>Having the motivation to complete the action is up to you, but choosing the task is easy. Here are four criteria for making the decision:</p>

<h2 id="1-context">1. Context</h2>

<p>Based on your current location and the tools at your disposal, what actions are you able to complete? There’s no point in looking at the work you need to do at the office if you’re at home.</p>

<p>If you’ve <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/getting-things-done-clarify/">set up your next action lists</a>, look at the list you’ve created for the context that you’re in. That will show you the actions that are possible to complete right now.</p>

<h2 id="2-time">2. Time</h2>

<p>Once you have the inventory of what you <em>can</em> work on, think about how much time you have. Don’t start a 30 minute report if you have 10 minutes before your next meeting.</p>

<h2 id="3-energy">3. Energy</h2>

<p>Is it morning and you’re full of energy? Or did you just finish a big meeting and you’re drained? Take this into account when choosing the task to work on. Don’t take on an intense project when you’re brain-dead and can’t think straight. Do some mundane tasks that will keep the ball rolling, but don’t take a lot of brain power. Save the high energy tasks for another time. Or better yet, learn to <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/power-full-engagement-book-review/">manage your energy levels</a>.</p>

<h2 id="4-priority">4. Priority</h2>

<p>What’s most important right now? You’ll likely need to trust your intuition here. After seeing what you’re able to work on and weighing the time and energy you have, trust your gut on which task to work on. You’ll know.</p>

<p>Consider these four criteria when you’re deciding what to work on next and you’ll simplify one of the most difficult decisions we face every day – what do I work on next?</p>

<p>In the next post, I’ll walk you through a typical day from my perspective and show how GTD frees up my creative capabilities.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/GTD-Reflect.jpg" /><p>The Weekly Review is the most important part of the GTD process. Without it, you’ll have loose ends and you’ll no longer trust your system.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Reflect is about taking the time to look at what you’re doing. You’ll make sure that you have everything in your system and that the tasks in your system are pushing you toward your goals.</p>

<p>Reviewing your system can have profound effects. You’ll start to see how much you have going on. You may realize that you’re over-extended or find extra time that you can use for a hobby or a new project.</p>

<p>Think about it this way — you wouldn’t put 100 items on your calendar for 7pm on Friday night, would you? Of course not! You can’t be 100 places at one time.</p>

<p>Seeing over-commitments on our calendars is easy. But seeing it with tasks is difficult if we’re not looking over our system in the same way that we look over our calendar.</p>

<p>David Allen recommends at least a single Weekly Review. I do <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/gaining-perspective-daily-review/">a daily review</a> as well as weekly, monthly, and yearly, but the core of GTD revolves around a weekly version. So once a week, you should schedule some time with yourself to walk through the following items:</p>

<h2 id="1-bring-yourself-up-to-date">1. Bring yourself up to date</h2>

<p>Clear out all of your inboxes and put all of your stuff in <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/getting-things-done-clarify/">the appropriate buckets</a>.</p>

<h2 id="2-review-next-action-lists">2. Review Next Action Lists</h2>

<p>Go through all of your action lists and decide what you’re going to work on this week. Try to be realistic. Our minds always like to give us more than we can handle.</p>

<h2 id="3-review-the-calendar">3. Review the calendar</h2>

<p>Look over last week’s calendar and the calendar for the upcoming weeks. This will help you see potential areas of improvement and plan for upcoming events.</p>

<h2 id="4-review-waiting-for-list">4. Review @Waiting For List</h2>

<p>Looking at the list of items you’re waiting for can help you decide if there is anything you need to follow up on.</p>

<h2 id="5-review-projects-list">5. Review Projects List</h2>

<p>How far along are each of your projects? Do you have at least one action assigned to each project you’re working on? Are there any actions to add or check off? Are there any projects that you can mark as completed?</p>

<h2 id="6-review-somedaymaybe-lists">6. Review Someday/Maybe Lists</h2>

<p>If you have some bandwidth available, review these lists for projects you could make active in your system.</p>

<p>Go through the entire system. Yes, <em>everything</em>. Review it all and make sure it’s up-to-date and trustworthy. You have to trust your system in order to act on the items in it. We’ll pick up next time with how to work toward your goals.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/GTD-Organize.jpg" /><p>Organize. The favorite step of most GTDers. This is where you set up tools for tracking each bucket from the <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/getting-things-done-clarify/">Clarify step</a>.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>People can spend hours researching and testing potential apps, websites, and services. With the app boom in full swing there are hundreds (maybe thousands) of to-do managers out there.</p>

<p>But you have to step back and think about it. What works for you? What do you want in an app? Don’t go out there looking at everything that <em>might</em> work. Think about what you need and search for that.</p>

<p>You’re looking to put four different systems in place. Keep in mind that some tools can do more than one. Here are the four:</p>

<h2 id="reference-material">Reference Material</h2>

<p>For all the items you collect that have no action assigned, you’ll need a place for long-term storage. If you’re a paper person, you’ll want to invest in a filing cabinet. David Allen suggests using an A-Z filing system to limit the number of places that something could be.</p>

<p>If you’re a paperless person, you’ll be looking for some kind of long-term storage solution. The one that most have found to work well is Evernote. Another that is similar is OneNote.</p>

<p>I prefer to have my reference material with me at all times, which led me to a cloud-based solution. I’ve developed a split system between Evernote and DropBox. Evernote holds everything except actual files. For that I use <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/file-naming-disorganization/">a (dis)organized system</a> in DropBox.</p>

<p>Evernote users will be either notebook-based or tag-based. I’m tag-based and have developed <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/simple-trick-naming-tags/">a tagging system</a> that makes it easy for me to quickly find anything I’m looking for.</p>

<h2 id="list-manager">List Manager</h2>

<p>Boiled down, GTD is about managing lists. That’s it. You’re looking for a list manager. Some are quite advanced and others are simple. You can use something robust like <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/omnifocus-setup-workflow/">Omnifocus</a> but you can also keep track of lists in a simple text file. The level of detail and the amount of functionality that you want is up to you. Keep in mind that the majority of what you’re collecting will go here.</p>

<p>When looking for a list manager make sure you have the ability to look at your projects and your contexts from different views. You will find it much easier to manage if you can plan out your projects in one view and work from another.</p>

<p>Here’s an article on how I <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/omnifocus-setup-workflow/">use Omnifocus</a> for this.</p>

<h2 id="calendar">Calendar</h2>

<p>It’s best to only add items to your calendar that you need to be present for. That includes meetings, local events, commitments to your kids, or even agreements with yourself. Whatever they are, you <em>will</em> be there for them without question. To-dos and reminders are best kept in your list manager and tickler systems.</p>

<p>Currently, I’m using a mix of MS Exchange and Google Calendar. All commitments with another person go on the Exchange calendar so I’m seen as “busy” and to keep others from booking meetings during these times at work.</p>

<p>Any agreements with myself that don’t involve someone else go into my Google Calendar. These can include times for writing, intentional thinking, brainstorming, or administrative tasks. I keep them here so they don’t mess with my availability on the Exchange server.</p>

<p>I deviate from the rule of “meetings with a person” in my Exchange calendar when I have an agreement with myself that I feel is important.</p>

<h2 id="tickler">Tickler</h2>

<p>The original concept behind the Tickler is an intricate system of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tickler_file">43 folders</a>. You name 12 of them after the months and number the remaining 31 for each day of the month. You look at the folder for the month and day for today to see what items you need to see or make a decision on today. It’s a system that worked well when we didn’t have a computer in our pocket at all times.</p>

<p>Today, we can use reminder applications and calendars to make the Tickler more robust than checking a folder in the morning.</p>

<p>I’m using a separate calendar in Google for events that I want to remember but haven’t committed to. I set up a reminder on an Evernote note with information I want sent to myself at a specific time. If it’s just a simple reminder, I’ll add it to Apple’s Reminders on the iPhone.</p>

<h2 id="what-comes-next">What comes next?</h2>

<p>You’ll want to review your system at different levels before you decide what to do each day. You need perspective to intuitively choose where your time is best spent. That’s where we’ll pick up next time.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/GTD-Clarify.jpg" /><p>A lot of people write things down but fail to do anything with it afterwards. It just dies on the paper. Why write it down if you’ll never look at it again?</p>

<!--more-->

<p>At this point, you’ve implemented the habit of <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/getting-things-done-capture/"><em>Capture</em></a>. You’re collecting things in your inboxes and you’re ready for the next step — <em>Clarify</em>.</p>

<p>Clarify is the process of taking each item in your inbox and making a decision about it. You’ll empty your inboxes by deciding what you need to do with each item in them.</p>

<h2 id="the-buckets">The buckets</h2>

<p>There are eight places that you can put these items. To help visualize this, here is a <a href="http://gettingthingsdone.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/workflow_map.pdf">link to the workflow map</a> from David Allen that shows the process. Here are the eight buckets:</p>

<h3 id="1-trash">1. Trash</h3>

<p>Throw it out. Honestly, if you’re never going to do anything with it and you don’t need it for reference, get rid of it. There’s no need for it to stick around and clutter things up.</p>

<h3 id="2-somedaymaybe">2. Someday/Maybe</h3>

<p>You wrote down the name of a book you want to read, an app you want to try, or a business deal you might want to make in the future. They’re items that you want to keep track of but don’t have time for right now. Keep Someday/Maybe lists of those items. You’ll want to come back to them when you have the bandwidth later on.</p>

<h3 id="3-tickler">3. Tickler</h3>

<p>A tickler helps you remember something that you want to make a decision on or use at a later time. There’s a concert in the local park that you might want to attend, but you’re not sure. You need a way to record that item and have it come back to you at a time when you can make a better decision. Or you may have information like a hotel confirmation that you don’t need to see until check-in. The tickler is a way to do this.</p>

<h3 id="4-reference">4. Reference</h3>

<p>There are always items that we need to hold on to indefinitely. Manuals, house closing papers, statements, confirmations, etc… You need some way to keep track of it all. Create a place where you can store this information and do it in <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/file-naming-disorganization/">a way that makes it easy to find</a> what you’re after.</p>

<h3 id="5-waiting-for">5. Waiting For</h3>

<p>I’ve found this to be an important bucket. It’s a list of all the items that you are waiting to happen. You might be waiting on a package to arrive or you need a coworker to complete a task. Keep a list of the things you’re waiting for.</p>

<h3 id="6-next-action-lists">6. Next Action lists</h3>

<p>This is the big one. A large portion of the stuff you’ll right down are actions you need to take. You <em>have</em> to put them on lists that you’ll work from. And those lists are based on <em>contexts</em>.</p>

<p>Contexts are lists of tasks that are organized by the tools, mindset, energy, or time you need to complete the action. You can think of contexts as tagging the action so you can consolidate them later. Here are some examples:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Calls - a list of all the phone calls you need to make.</li>
  <li>MacBook - a list of items that you can only work on when you’re on your laptop.</li>
  <li>Sprints - a list of tasks that you can do from anywhere on any device that will take 10 minutes or less.</li>
  <li>Read/Review - a list of items that you need to read through.</li>
  <li>Grocery Store - a list of the things you need from the store.</li>
  <li>Mom - a list of things you need to talk to mom about.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="7-calendar">7. Calendar</h3>

<p>The calendar is something that most of us have used for a long time. But what do you put on it? The only thing you should really put on your calendar are items that you’re committed to doing at a specific time in the day. To-dos that don’t have a time associated with them need to be on your Next Action lists. Keep your calendar true to your commitments. It becomes the hard landscape that you follow for the day.</p>

<h3 id="8-project-list">8. Project List</h3>

<p>Keep a list of the projects you’re working on. Remember, a project is defined by having two or more actions in order to complete it. Even changing a light bulb could be a project if you need to buy the light bulb and then replace it. That’s two steps and would be called a project.</p>

<p>If you maintain a list of these projects, you don’t have to worry about forgetting to complete one of them. You also have a point of reference for making decisions on what comes next for the project.</p>

<h2 id="deciding-on-the-bucket">Deciding on the bucket</h2>

<p>The nice thing about the Clarify step in the workflow is that it has it’s own process to help you decide what to do with the stuff in your inboxes. It becomes intuitive over time, but starting out I found myself referring to this <a href="http://gettingthingsdone.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/workflow_map.pdf">workflow map</a> a lot. Here are the four questions to ask yourself when deciding where to put each item:</p>

<h3 id="1-what-is-it">1. What is it?</h3>

<p>Go to your inbox and pick the first item. What is it? Sounds like a simple question, but it’s sometimes harder to decide than you think. Is it a manual, a random thought, or a business idea? You can’t decide what to do with it if you don’t know what it is.</p>

<h3 id="2-is-it-actionable">2. Is it actionable?</h3>

<p>Is it something you need act on? If not, do you need to hold on to it? If the answer is no, trash it. If you need to keep it but don’t need to act on it right away, you can put it on a Someday/Maybe list for later, store it in your Reference system, or add it to your Tickler.</p>

<p>If it <em>is</em> something you need to act on soon, what’s the next action?</p>

<h3 id="3-whats-the-next-action">3. What’s the next action?</h3>

<p>By asking the simple question, “What comes next?” we’re changing the noun into a verb. We’re taking “New furnace” and turning it into “Google reviews for a new furnace.” What is the next physical thing you need to do in order to make progress on it?</p>

<p>Is there a phone call you need to make? Do you need to pick something up at the store? Is there an email to send, a file to create, a book to read, or an article to review? Do you need to Google something? The action can take a lot of different forms, but identifying it is key.</p>

<p>Pro tip: Try asking this question at the end of meetings or at the end of a conversation with someone. It can change the pace of your work and provide a lot of clarity.</p>

<h3 id="4-do-it-delegate-it-or-defer-it">4. Do it, delegate it, or defer it?</h3>

<p>With the next action decided, you have three options — do it, delegate it, or defer it.</p>

<p>If it’s possible to complete the action in two minutes or less, do it right then. It’ll take you longer to store it and come back to it than it would take to do it right away. So get it out of the way.</p>

<p>Maybe you’re not the right person to be doing the action at all. If that’s the case, then you need to take the action of giving it to someone else and store it on your Waiting For list.</p>

<p>If it’s something you need to do later, then defer it. Put it on one of your Next Action lists. If it’s something that needs to be done on a specific day, it goes on your calendar.</p>

<p>If it’s an action that has multiple steps, add it to your Project List. You don’t want to complete the first action item and then lose track of the stuff that comes later.</p>

<h2 id="what-comes-next">What comes next?</h2>

<p>The Clarify step is probably one of most helpful steps in the workflow because it helps get things out of your head and into an external brain of some kind. It helps you clear your mind and <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/getting-things-done-introduction/">opens up your creativity</a>.</p>

<p>The next step in the workflow is Organize. It’s important to organize each of these buckets in a useful way, and there are a LOT of tools available to help.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/GTD-Capture.jpg" /><p><em>Capture</em> is the process of collecting ideas and actions. You’re accumulating task items, reference material, or even trash and putting them in an inbox of some kind.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="why-capture">Why capture?</h2>

<p>Quite simply, capturing allows you to get something off your mind. When a thought hits your brain, it can (and will) suppress all other thoughts until you do something about it. You can act on it right away, write it down, hope it comes back later, or lose it forever. If you choose to act on a thought right away, go for it. I wish I could do that for every idea that comes to me. But I don’t have time for that. There are too many ideas and things I want to do. Hoping for it to come back later just sounds like a bad idea, and losing it forever will certainly get me in trouble. So writing things down it is. If you write it down (and you can trust that you’ll come back to it), you free up your mind to focus on the task or person in front of you. But you also give yourself a way to see just how much you have on your plate. You can see the crazy amount of stuff you want to do. And that’s a sobering experience.</p>

<h2 id="what-should-you-capture">What should you capture?</h2>

<p>Capture everything that you want to do someday or want to remember. But you should also capture anything that’s on your mind. If it’s occupying your thoughts and you need to do something about it, write it down.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I need to send out that development update.</li>
  <li>I want to learn how to make bread.</li>
  <li>I really enjoy airplanes.</li>
  <li>We need toilet paper.</li>
  <li>Is an iPhone 6 really worth it?</li>
  <li>I need to winterize the lawnmower.</li>
  <li>We want to replace the car in 3 (maybe 5) years.</li>
</ul>

<p>It can be anything. If it’s something that comes to mind that you might want to act on in the future, write it down. You can come back to it and make decisions about it later. You want it off your mind.</p>

<h2 id="two-times-to-capture">Two times to capture</h2>

<p>Write things down when they come to you. That means you need to have some way of doing this at all times. It’s frustrating to have an idea come to you and you can’t find <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/what-is-an-hpda-and-how-do-i-use-it/">pen and paper anywhere</a>. So you need to have tools with you at all times to capture things when your mind decides to ambush you. There’s also a time for doing what David calls a <a href="http://gettingthingsdone.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Mind_Sweep_Trigger_List.pdf">Mind Sweep</a>. It’s a list of triggers to help your mind think of things that you need to capture or do something with. These are helpful when you’re first starting out, but I’ve found them to be great to do on a weekly basis as well.</p>

<h2 id="where-to-put-them">Where to put them</h2>

<p>Inboxes. Whether it’s a physical tray that you put pieces of paper in or a digital system, you want your bits of captured information to go into an inbox. In the next step of the workflow you’ll process these bits and determine what you need to do with them. But at this point you just need to throw it into an inbox. For reference, here are some of my inboxes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Physical inbox tray</li>
  <li><a href="http://joebuhlig.com/omnifocus-setup-workflow/">Omnifocus</a> inbox</li>
  <li>Inbox for <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/file-naming-disorganization/">files in DropBox</a></li>
  <li>RSS feeds in <a href="http://feedly.com">Feedly</a></li>
  <li>An inbox notebook in <a href="https://www.evernote.com/referral/Registration.action?uid=49404&amp;sig=e2dd914576c3ec9818e0311976a19dc1">Evernote</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-fun-part---ubiquitous-tools">The fun part - ubiquitous tools</h2>

<p>If you’re planning to write things down and your mind can fling things at you whenever it wants, then you need to have tools with you at all times. The most popular ways to do this involve small notebooks that you carry everywhere and apps for your phone. I use both. I’ve found the easiest way to capture to be <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/what-is-an-hpda-and-how-do-i-use-it/">an hPDA</a> that I carry everywhere. I always have a piece of paper with me and as a bonus, I have a way to write things down for other people as well. I simply give them one of my index cards. Any time I go near my physical inbox beside my desk at home, I throw any cards that I’ve written on into the tray. I know that I’ll empty it later, so I don’t have to think about those items anymore. The other way I capture is using <a href="http://agiletortoise.com/drafts/">Drafts</a> on my phone. It’s super easy. I launch the app and start typing right away. When I’m done, I can send that text to a number of places, but mostly it goes to my Omnifocus inbox. Again, I know that I’ll process those items later. Between these two methods I find that writing it down is easier. It’s nice to have it collected digitally, but it seems to take longer that way. But I do it anyway.</p>

<h2 id="what-comes-next">What comes next?</h2>

<p>Now that you’ve piled stuff in your inbox, you need to do something with it. Otherwise it’ll sit on your desk and die from lack of attention. You need to come back to it and <em>Clarify</em> what you’re going to do about it. We’ll jump into that in the next post.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/GTD-Introduction.jpg" /><p>Why do we think we can manage our lives with only our memory? It’s certainly flawed. It doesn’t even remind us of what we need when we need it. It waits until we’re in bed and can’t do anything about it.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>We have loads of “stuff” that we try to keep track of in our minds. We have random <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/managing-project-information/">information about work projects</a>, a bucket list, things we need someone else to complete, batteries to change in the thermostat, water to turn off for the winter, sound to run at church this weekend, and the list goes on and on. And it grows faster than we can knock them out. It’s no wonder we’re all stressed and forget things constantly. The part that drives me crazy is the nagging. Our brains won’t stop thinking about a task until it’s done. Our minds continue to bring it up (with bad timing) over and over again until we do something about it.</p>

<h2 id="getting-things-done-gtd">Getting Things Done (GTD)</h2>

<p>This is the start of a series of posts about GTD. It’s a system developed (or discovered depending on how you look at it) by David Allen in the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WH7PKY?btkr=1">book by the same name</a> with the great subtitle “The Art of Stress-Free Productivity.” It’s a framework that solves our problem with “stuff.” There are <a href="http://gettingthingsdone.com/fivesteps/">5 steps to GTD</a> that I’ll dive into with upcoming posts, but here’s a quick overview:</p>

<ol>
  <li><em>Capture</em> - When a thought or action comes to mind that you need (or want) to do something with, grab it right then.</li>
  <li><em>Clarify</em> - Go through the “stuff” that you collected in step one and give it meaning.</li>
  <li><em>Organize</em> - Put it in place. Take your defined items and get them into lists for later use.</li>
  <li><em>Reflect</em> - Look over your lists to do any clean up and decide what comes next.</li>
  <li><em>Engage</em> - Do it. Now that you have everything in place, do something about it.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="mind-like-water">Mind Like Water</h2>

<p>The main goal behind GTD is to free up your mind. As David Allen likes to say, “Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them.” If you get things out of your head and into your trusted system, you can focus your mind on the task at hand or the person in front of you as opposed to remembering what you need to do next. It’s a way of bringing yourself back to the present because you’re not worrying about all the things you have to do. If you throw a rock into a calm pond, you see a splash and then some ripples start to form. The water reacts to forces around it in that moment and then slowly returns to its original state. GTD is a way to give your mind that ability. Getting things out of your mind and into a trusted system allows you to react to the new things coming at you and then return to your original state.</p>

<h2 id="my-personal-angle">My personal angle</h2>

<p>GTD doesn’t dictate the tools that you use. It’s a framework that you use with whatever tools you choose. I’ll be showing the main points of each step in upcoming articles, but keep in mind that I’m an Apple fan and a digital person. I like to avoid analog. Though I do <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/what-is-an-hpda-and-how-do-i-use-it/">keep paper around</a> for taking notes and writing down ideas, I promptly transfer it to a computer and throw it away. The system is geek-friendly and yet easily used in an analog form. There are a number of people who work the system using only pen and paper. And it works great for them. You’ll need to choose tools that you are already familiar with and enjoy using.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/The-Why-of-Getting-Up-Early.jpg" /><p>It’s 4:55 am. I roll over to check the clock and realize I’m awake before my alarm goes off. That’s always a good feeling. But why am I awake at this time of day?</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Morning people all over the internet love to tell you about the benefits of getting up early. There are studies that show morning people to be more successful and these folks love to point it out. They think <em>everyone</em> should get up early.</p>

<p>I can’t say that I agree. I don’t know that it would work for everyone. I know some folks that are definitely night owls and it would take a miracle to get them up at 5 in the morning.</p>

<p>But if you’re someone who wants to be one of those neurotic people who gets up early, you’d better have a darn good reason. Without it, you’ll be back to your old habits on day 2.</p>

<h2 id="one-off-early-mornings">One-off Early Mornings</h2>

<p>Think about the times when you <em>need</em> to get up early. You can drag yourself out of bed when you have a 6am flight to catch. 4am is no problem during deer season (yes, there’s a bit of redneck in me). You can wake up at 5am to beat traffic when traveling for Christmas. It’s not an issue because you have a good reason to be up early. You have a good “why.”</p>

<p>If you have a compelling reason to get up early, you do it. There might be some grumbles along the way, but you still do it. Translate that to every day. If you give yourself a good “why” for getting up early, you’ll do it.</p>

<h2 id="my-why">My “Why”</h2>

<p>For me, waking up at 5am is an everyday occurrence. However, it would be a nightmare if I just woke up and then tried to figure out what to do. I might as well stay in bed. Instead, I’ve figured out a “why” for my mornings. And no, waking up early to clean the house is not a compelling “why” for me.</p>

<p>My family typically starts to move around 7:30am. That means that I have 2.5 hours to myself if I’m up at 5. That’s the perfect time for me to do things that I don’t have time for during the day. It typically involves reading my Bible over a good breakfast, reviewing my goals, spending some time in the woodshop (though I’ve been missing that lately), catching up on web articles, reading a book, and writing for this blog.</p>

<p>Each of those items are things I love. They’re a great way to create momentum and <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/power-full-engagement-book-review/">energy</a> for the rest of the day, and they give me a great “why” for getting up in the morning.</p>

<p>That’s the key. If I wasn’t doing something that I really looked forward to, I would stay in bed. But I know that if I stay in bed, I won’t have a chance at any other time in the day. So 5am it is.</p>

<h3 id="considerations">Considerations:</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>I’m not advocating a lack of sleep. In order to get up early, you have to go to bed early as well. Make sure you’re getting enough sleep. I typically start my way to bed around 9pm as I need about 7.5 hours of sleep a night.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I would highly recommend putting together a Morning Ritual — a simple checklist of the items you want to do in the morning and how long you would like to spend on each. You don’t want to waste time in the morning figuring out what to do. Have a plan beforehand.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lay out breakfast and clothes the night before. I even set up my computer and iPad for my reading and writing the night before. If it’s easy to sit down and go right away, you’ll remove the resistance and possible distractions when trying to follow your plan.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Be consistent. The only reason I wake up before my alarm goes off is because I’m up at the same time, every day of the week. That includes Saturday and Sunday. If you keep a daily routine, it becomes natural and easy.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>In order to get up early and enjoy it, you need to have a compelling “why” behind it. Without that, you’re setting yourself up for failure. Enjoy getting up early!</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/Seasons-of-Tasks.jpg" /><p>The mornings are getting colder and the animals are preparing for winter. Another weather change is coming. And it’s a great reminder that we, too, should be preparing for the next season.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>A few times per week, I’ve been taking Cutie on a bike ride. We have one of those pull-behind carts that I strap her into. And she loves it! For a while she would even squeal as we went down hills. Talk about great inspiration for climbing hills.</p>

<p>This past Saturday I had pulled out the bike and was getting everything ready for another ride. It was cooler than it had been so I had an extra layer on and made sure Cutie was bundled up. It wasn’t enough. We started out on our normal route and I quickly noticed the wind. I was going to have my work cut out for me.</p>

<p>Our normal route is pretty open and the wind was really intense — not to mention cold. It wasn’t long and I was done. I had used all my energy fighting the wind and was starting to get cold as well. If I was getting cold, then I knew Cutie would be worse. We would have to head home early.</p>

<p>In retrospect, I know we didn’t have to follow our normal route. We could have gone a different way that was sheltered from the wind. But I failed to account for the rapidly changing season and the wind that comes with it in Minnesota. I didn’t think ahead.</p>

<h2 id="the-season-changes-what-you-do">The Season Changes What You Do</h2>

<p>How often do we do this? We get used to a pattern or routine and create a mess for ourselves when the weather changes. I know I’m terrible at it.</p>

<p>Whether it’s outdoor tasks versus indoor tasks, or a change in what you do for work doesn’t matter. We all deal with changes throughout the year in some form. The changes in weather determine if you’re raking leaves, building decks, or throwing snow.</p>

<p>But do you plan ahead for those changes? For some things I do but not for others. Though I’m getting better about it overall, I still go on bike rides under-prepared. I forget to finish the railing on the deck until it’s cold outside — and possibly snowing. Here’s an example of a quick system for Spring and Fall tasks. This could easily be used for holidays and traditions, birthdays, spring cleaning, and many others.</p>

<h2 id="seasonal-checklists">Seasonal Checklists</h2>

<p>In the Spring, there are a number of things that need to be done. Turn on the water to the outdoor spigots, service the mower, oil the springs on the garage door (who even knew you were supposed to do that?), put the screens back in the windows, change the furnace filter, and a few others.</p>

<p>These tasks happen every year. So it made sense to create a Spring Maintenance checklist. And since I’m always learning of more things that I’m supposed to do for Spring or Fall maintenance, (like oiling garage door springs), I’m always adding to the list.</p>

<p>Be prepared for upcoming changes that you know about. You know when Christmas is coming so you can save money in advance — as opposed to waiting and putting everything on a credit card. You know roughly when Winter is coming, so you can put things away and plan for it. Don’t be like me and realize what you need to do when it’s too late and your daughter’s nose is pink from the cold.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/The-Power-of-Full-Engagement-Book-Review.jpg" /><p>There’s a lot of advice on the web about managing your time. Everyone seems to have the golden ticket that will pull time out of thin air. But what if time isn’t the key to being fully engaged?</p>

<!--more-->

<p>We all have the same number of hours and minutes in a day. And yet there are folks who seem to accomplish a lot more than I do. Why is that? Why do some people have the uncanny ability to achieve like crazy when others struggle to keep up with day-to-day responsibilities?</p>

<p>Jim Loehr and Tony Schwartz wrote <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Power-Full-Engagement-Performance/dp/0743226755">The Power of Full Engagement</a></em> to answer this question. The tagline is: <em>Managing Energy, Not Time, Is the Key to High Performance and Personal Renewal.</em> The premise is that we need to balance our energy levels in order to be fully engaged with our work and relationships that surround us.</p>

<h2 id="four-layers-of-energy">Four Layers of Energy</h2>

<p>The book describes four layers of energy which build on each other in the form of a pyramid. As the book says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To be fully engaged, we must be physically energized, emotionally connected, mentally focused, and spiritually aligned with a purpose beyond our immediate self-interest.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img class="center-image" src="/assets/posts_extra/Energy-Pyramid.png" /></p>

<p>It’s important to note how the layers stack on top of each other. You can do nothing if you haven’t slept or eaten in two days. You need to start with the physical layer and then work your way up.</p>

<p>The goal for each energy level is to increase your capacity by seeking stress and then recovering. It’s similar to training for a marathon — you don’t go out and run 10 miles on day one. If you attempt this you will most likely come away injured and in pain. Instead, you start off walking. After walking each day, you run a 1/4 mile. After running 1/4 mile each day, you increase slightly until you’re running a mile. You continue this process of incremental increases until you’re running miles per day and able to take on a marathon. You stress your body and then recover in order to build your capacity for running.</p>

<p>Each of these energy levels is the same. We need to learn how to spend energy in each area and then recover. We need to take on the mentality of a training athlete to develop each area.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We, too, must learn to live our own lives as a series of sprints — fully engaging for periods of time, and then fully disengaging and seeking renewal before jumping back into the fray to face whatever challenges confront us.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let’s take a look at each of the four layers and how we can work to increase our capacity for each.</p>

<h3 id="physical-energy">Physical Energy</h3>

<p>Without physical energy we cannot accomplish anything. We need sleep to rejuvenate our bodies. We also need to exercise in order to gain overall health and build our physical energy capacity. We have to find a balance between physical expenditures and breaks. Without one, we atrophy and start to lose our fitness level. Without the other, we may die of exhaustion.</p>

<p>The other side of physical energy involves the food that we eat. As someone who works in agriculture, I have a vested interest in our food system. There are a lot of diets, mindsets, activists, and just plain bad science out there. And there is no shortage of tactics used to get you on the road they’ve paved. No matter the path you choose, eat healthy. Without good food coming in, your body can’t give you the energy you need to be effective.</p>

<h3 id="emotional-energy">Emotional Energy</h3>

<p>If you’re experiencing a lot of stress and negativity, you’ll never be fully engaged. You need to find things to do that bring you joy and help you recover from bad experiences. Again, endure stress and recover.</p>

<p>A good example of this would be a meeting that has gone badly. In order to build your capacity to handle these situations, you need to find things that help you re-energize after the meeting. Go for a walk outside or find someone to enjoy a cup of coffee with. Whatever it is, you need to find activities that bring you enjoyment and do them when you find negative emotions overwhelming you.</p>

<h3 id="mental-energy">Mental Energy</h3>

<p>Focus and concentration. Visualizing positive experiences and avoiding negative self-talk. These are key to fully engaging with your mental energy. It’s hard to deliver a great result when you don’t have faith in yourself. Taking time to visualize a positive outcome on a project can help you focus on creating a stellar product.</p>

<p>To build your capacity for mental energy and focus, you need to engage in mentally challenging tasks. The book suggests that meditation is the best method for learning to work with a focused mind.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mental acuity diminishes in the absence of ongoing intellectual challenge.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="spiritual-energy">Spiritual Energy</h3>

<p>Don’t confuse this with religion. That’s not the point the book is trying to make. They’re referring to the purpose or drive behind you. You have to have a reason to work. Without it you are simply going through motions and maintaining the status quo.</p>

<p>You need to determine what your drive is. What makes you do what you do? Once you’ve determined that, you need to review it regularly. You can’t let it slip your mind or you’ll be right back to being disengaged with your purpose.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Spiritual energy provides the force for action in all dimensions of our lives. It fuels passion, perseverance and commitment.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-power-of-rituals">The Power of Rituals</h2>

<p>The book doesn’t just give you the concepts, but also helps you find ways to put them into practice. The key is to adopt rituals or routines. Rituals are something you do at the same time and place, in the same way, and in the same order.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Positive energy rituals — highly specific routines for managing energy — are the key to full engagement and sustained high performance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The point behind rituals is to create a structure in which we can thrive. If we have a routine that helps us push ourselves and then recover, we have an automatic way of being fully engaged in any circumstance.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The power of rituals is that they insure that we use as little conscious energy as possible where it is not absolutely necessary, leaving us free to strategically focus energy available to us in creative, enriching ways.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here are some examples of rituals that I’ve put in place:</p>

<h3 id="1-morning-routine">1. Morning routine</h3>

<p>I’ve created a ritual that starts the moment I wake up. I quickly dress and grab breakfast. I spend some time reading my Bible and then head to the woodshop for a bit. Then I write for an hour and about the time I’m finished Cutie decides it’s time to tackle the day. If she’s still sleeping, I start in on my <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/choosing-3-important-tasks-day/">3 most important tasks</a> for the day. When she wakes up, I change a diaper, get breakfast ready for her, and get second breakfast (plus coffee) for myself.</p>

<p>I do my best writing first thing in the morning. If I don’t spend time in the woodshop in the morning, I won’t make time for it elsewhere. If I do these two energizing rituals in the morning, I’ve got a great feeling about the day already and I’m ready to be super productive.</p>

<h3 id="2-email">2. Email</h3>

<p>I’ve written about my <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/escaping-corporate-email-habit/">escape from the corporate email habit</a> before. The book goes into email quite a bit and I’ve read numerous articles about the dangers of checking email constantly. Yes, there are jobs that require you to be on email all day, but I don’t have one of those. I typically check email twice a day — 9am and 3pm. Email can easily derail my day and drastically cut the amount of work I can complete. It’s an energy drain for me. So I limit the energy I spend on it by putting these timed rituals in place.</p>

<h3 id="3-personalwork-transitions">3. Personal/Work Transitions</h3>

<p>This one has always been hard for me and I don’t expect it to get much easier. The “going to work” and “coming home” transitions create problems for most. You have to switch your brain from thinking about work to thinking about personal or vice versa. I’ve found that if I do something unrelated to either and do it consistently, my brain knows what comes next. This makes the transition easier. I also know that I place a high value in learning. So I watch a TED talk between my work day and the time when I “head home” — or go upstairs. It makes a great separation point that is consistent and I can count on.</p>

<h3 id="4-cycling">4. Cycling</h3>

<p>I’ve taken on cycling as a mode of exercise. It’s something that I enjoy, but haven’t spent a lot of time with. I now try to get on the bike at least three times a week. I usually take Cutie with me in a pull-behind cart. It adds a little resistance for a great workout and it gives Becky some time to herself as well.</p>

<h2 id="next-actions">Next Actions</h2>

<p>This is one of those books that can be life changing. I discovered it when reading <a href="http://www.asianefficiency.com/health/energy-management-for-optimal-productivity/">an article</a> from the guys at <a href="http://www.asianefficiency.com/">Asian Efficiency</a>.</p>

<p>I discovered what my values are and wrote a mission statement for myself. But those are only good if I review them often, so I look them over every morning. I keep an eye on my energy in each of the four areas and make sure that I’m renewing myself as often as I need. If I find that I’m falling into a rut, I look for a ritual that I can use to help me regain energy regularly. So far it’s been a journey I’ve really enjoyed.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/Creating-Personal-Project-Codes.jpg" /><p>Last week I wrote about <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/managing-project-information/">managing information for projects</a>. In that post I revealed the project codes I use, and now we’re going to talk about how to create them.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>As a quick refresher, here’s what my codes look like:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">14HC13</code></pre></figure>

<p>There are three portions of the code — “14”, “HC”, and “13.”</p>

<h2 id="year">Year</h2>

<p>The first two characters are the year. In this case, 2014 becomes “14”. I plan to use these indefinitely so I need a way to distinguish them year over year. If it crosses over the new year, it gets the earlier of the two since the code is created at the start of the project.</p>

<h2 id="area-of-responsibility">Area of Responsibility</h2>

<p>The middle two characters indicate the area of life that it pertains to. In the example above it’s “HC”, which is short for “House/Car.” I currently have 11.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Spiritual = “SP”</li>
  <li>Joe Buhlig = “ME”</li>
  <li>Husband = “HU”</li>
  <li>Father = “FA”</li>
  <li>Son/Brother = “SB”</li>
  <li>Work = “WK”</li>
  <li>Blog = “BL”</li>
  <li>Friend = “FR”</li>
  <li>Church = “CH”</li>
  <li>House/Car = “HC”</li>
  <li>Woodworking = “WW”</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="incrementing-number">Incrementing Number</h2>

<p>It’s a simple auto-incrementing number that resets to “01” the first time I use it in a new year. The first time it is “01.” The second it’s “02,” then “03” and so on.</p>

<h2 id="creating-the-codes">Creating the Codes</h2>

<p>Creating the code is made simple with a <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/using-text-expander/">TextExpander snippet</a>. I can type “;phc” (project for House/Car) and it will expand to be 14HC04. If I were to type it again, it would be 14HC05. The last two digits continue to increase each time I use it. I have a separate snippet created for each of my Areas of Responsibility from above, which means that each area has it’s own incrementing number. Here are the abbreviations I use for each:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Spiritual = “;psp”</li>
  <li>Joe Buhlig = “;pme”</li>
  <li>Husband = “;phu”</li>
  <li>Father = “;pfa”</li>
  <li>Son/Brother = “;psb”</li>
  <li>Work = “;pwk”</li>
  <li>Blog = “;pbl”</li>
  <li>Friend = “;pfr”</li>
  <li>Church = “;pch”</li>
  <li>House/Car = “;phc”</li>
  <li>Woodworking = “;pww”</li>
</ol>

<p>I create a note for each new project in Evernote to act as an idea collection zone. I use the TextExpander snippet to create the code as part of the note’s title. If I’m going to put the code in a filename or another note title, I grab it from this “master” note in Evernote and copy/paste where I need it.</p>

<h2 id="the-setup">The Setup</h2>

<p>Here’s the tricky part. It involves two pieces to make it work — a .plist file in Dropbox and a TextExpander snippet with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AppleScript">AppleScript</a>.</p>

<h3 id="the-plist-file">The .plist file</h3>

<p>As far as I know, TextExpander doesn’t have a good way to auto-increment numbers on it’s own. Not without the help of an external file of some kind. So I set up a .plist file to store the last used code. A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Property_list">.plist file</a> is a Property List file that kind of resembles an XML file, but is Apple specific. Most of the applications that we use every day utilize them.</p>

<p>I created the initial file using Xcode and at the moment it looks like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-xml" data-lang="xml"><span class="nt">&lt;plist</span> <span class="na">version=</span><span class="s">"1.0"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;dict&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;key&gt;</span>Blog<span class="nt">&lt;/key&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;string&gt;</span>14BL26<span class="nt">&lt;/string&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;key&gt;</span>Church<span class="nt">&lt;/key&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;string&gt;</span>14CH00<span class="nt">&lt;/string&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;key&gt;</span>Father<span class="nt">&lt;/key&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;string&gt;</span>14FA01<span class="nt">&lt;/string&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;key&gt;</span>Friend<span class="nt">&lt;/key&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;string&gt;</span>14FR00<span class="nt">&lt;/string&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;key&gt;</span>HouseCar<span class="nt">&lt;/key&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;string&gt;</span>14HC05<span class="nt">&lt;/string&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;key&gt;</span>Husband<span class="nt">&lt;/key&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;string&gt;</span>14HU05<span class="nt">&lt;/string&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;key&gt;</span>JoeBuhlig<span class="nt">&lt;/key&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;string&gt;</span>14ME15<span class="nt">&lt;/string&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;key&gt;</span>SonBrother<span class="nt">&lt;/key&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;string&gt;</span>14SB00<span class="nt">&lt;/string&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;key&gt;</span>Spiritual<span class="nt">&lt;/key&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;string&gt;</span>14SP03<span class="nt">&lt;/string&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;key&gt;</span>Woodworking<span class="nt">&lt;/key&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;string&gt;</span>14WW00<span class="nt">&lt;/string&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;key&gt;</span>Work<span class="nt">&lt;/key&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;string&gt;</span>14WK16<span class="nt">&lt;/string&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;/dict&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/plist&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>I store this file in DropBox since I use multiple computers and don’t always know which one I will need to create the code.</p>

<h3 id="the-textexpander-applescript">The TextExpander AppleScript</h3>

<p>Here’s a look at the AppleScript in the House/Car TextExpander snippet:</p>

<p>It goes to the .plist file and gets the current project code. It then parses out the last two characters and increments it by one unless we’re in a new new year. At the beginning of each year, it will reset to “01” and change the first two characters to match the new year. It then writes the code back to the .plist file for next time and pastes in the new code. It just looks more complicated than it really is :)</p>

<p>The main takeaway is that I enter the abbreviation for the TextExpander snippet and it runs the AppleScript. The AppleScript updates the stored code and replaces the abbreviation with the new code. I type 4 characters and I’m done!</p>

<p>It looks like a daunting process if you’ve never worked with .plist files or AppleScript and rightly so. The first time I saw them I thought the people who used them were crazy. And maybe we are. But it certainly makes life easier when it comes to finding project materials.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/Managing-Project-Information.jpg" /><p>Using David Allen’s definition, a project is anything that requires more than one action to complete. This can range from building a new web application to replacing the refrigerator filter.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>With this definition in mind, it’s easy to see how your list of projects can be long. And being a knowledge worker, I have thousands of files and hundreds of meeting notes and whiteboard pictures — all of which are digital. Here’s a scenario:</p>

<h2 id="building-a-deck">Building a Deck</h2>

<p>Last summer I built a deck off the back of our house. I like doing handyman projects and I was looking forward to the challenge. Since I didn’t know what I was doing, I did a lot of research on the design and how to build it.</p>

<p>I planned out the actions in <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus">Omnifocus</a> and clipped about a hundred pictures and how-to articles from the web into <a href="https://www.evernote.com/referral/Registration.action?uid=49404&amp;sig=e2dd914576c3ec9818e0311976a19dc1">Evernote</a>. I also had some files that I downloaded to reference during the build. I had a lot of information before I had even started — and this was only one project. I usually have about 50 going at once.</p>

<p>There were a number of times when I spent an embarrassing amount of time looking for a picture I had clipped.</p>

<p>Now multiply this by 50 projects. It can quickly become a mess. I spent a lot of time working on this problem, since I knew it wouldn’t go away. Eventually, I found a solution that I’m rather fond of.</p>

<h2 id="where-do-you-put-it">Where do you put it?</h2>

<p>The first step is deciding what type of information goes where. For me, that means action items go into Omnifocus, files go into Dropbox with <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/file-naming-disorganization/">my file nomenclature</a>, and everything else goes into Evernote. I highly recommend using as few places as you can for information. It reduces the number of places you’ll have to look later on.</p>

<h2 id="personal-project-codes">Personal Project Codes</h2>

<p>The next step is to find a way to quickly pull up the data for a project. I experimented with this for a while and eventually came up with the idea for personal project codes. We use them for business all the time. Why don’t I use them for me? Seems logical.</p>

<p>The idea is simple. Append a project code to the name of every project in Omnifocus, note in Evernote, and the filename for a file. Because it becomes part of the names in each of these, I tried to keep mine as short as possible.</p>

<p>For me, the codes look like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">14HC13</code></pre></figure>

<p>Decoded, the “14” is for the year 2014. “HC” stands for House/Car. It’s a 2 character indicator for the area of responsibility in my life. I have 11, but a few of those are “WK” for work, “HU” for husband, “BL” for this blog, and “FR” for friend. The last two characters in the code is an auto-incrementing number. I use a <a href="http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/index.html">TextExpander</a> snippet to create my codes and it automatically increases this number by one every time I create a new one. I’m writing a post on this snippet to come out next week.</p>

<p>I create the code the first time in Evernote when I name the project. For the deck, the note was titled “14HC13: Build Deck” and contains any initial ideas, outcomes, or brainstorming. I do this for every new project. This is key because I can search Evernote for the code of the project I want. But in most cases, I’ve worked with the code long enough that I just know it.</p>

<h2 id="the-benefits">The Benefits</h2>

<p>Because the code is in the name of the item, I can search for it and pull up just the information for that project. I can see all of the notes I’ve taken for a project or all the files I’ve collected. I’ve even been exploring <a href="http://www.cocoatech.com/pathfinder/">Path Finder</a> and trying to find ways to pull up Omnifocus, Evernote, and my files all in a single search.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/Pros-and-Cons-of-Apple-Watch.jpg" /><p>Last Tuesday, Apple unveiled their new Smart Watch— the <a href="http://www.apple.com/watch/">Apple Watch</a>. It came with a lot of fanfare and definitely looks compelling. But is it really going to be worth it?</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I ask this question mostly for myself. I drank the Apple Kool-aid and now find myself wanting every new device they come out with. I already decided that the iPhone 6 wasn’t enough of a change to warrant an upgrade for me… but should I pick up an Apple Watch?</p>

<h2 id="pros">Pros</h2>

<h3 id="1-activity-monitor">1. Activity Monitor</h3>

<p>I’ve been debating a <a href="https://jawbone.com/up">Jawbone</a> or a <a href="http://www.fitbit.com/flex">FitBit</a> for quite some time. Having an activity-tracking device built into my watch that perfectly integrates with my Apple ecosystem would be perfect! I’m starting to get into cycling and this would make the data collection much easier.</p>

<h3 id="2-directions">2. Directions</h3>

<p>Many of us are using our phones for directions. It would be nice to have them on my wrist for easy access while I’m driving or walking. It simply adds a convenience factor.</p>

<h3 id="3-new-communication-methods">3. New Communication Methods</h3>

<p>With the new drawing, tapping, and heartbeat messages available, styles of communication can change. And that’s kind of cool.</p>

<h3 id="4-wallet">4. Wallet</h3>

<p>Using <a href="http://www.apple.com/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a>, you can pay for things using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Near_field_communication">NFC</a> through your watch. It makes transactions easier.</p>

<h3 id="5-remote">5. Remote</h3>

<p>We use an Apple TV for Netflix and streaming video from my iPad. Controlling the TV from my watch would keep me from reaching for the remote. Because we all know that might kill me.</p>

<h2 id="cons">Cons</h2>

<h3 id="1-big-distraction">1. Big Distraction</h3>

<p>It seems I’d be able to do a lot and do it quickly from Apple Watch. Although that can be perceived as a great thing, it would be <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/put-distractions-place/">distracting</a>. I can too easily see myself ignoring my family when my watch vibrates.</p>

<h3 id="2-increased-screen-time">2. Increased Screen Time</h3>

<p>It’s right there on my wrist. It’s a screen in front of me the moment I want it. Screen time will only go up if it’s that easy.</p>

<h3 id="3-always-available">3. Always Available</h3>

<p>It brings <em>all</em> of our communication methods right to my wrist. That means that if someone calls, emails, texts, tweets, or facebooks me in any way, I have it front of me immediately. I’m not ok with that.</p>

<h3 id="4-wallet-1">4. Wallet</h3>

<p>Since your watch becomes a wallet, it’s way too easy to buy things we don’t need. Just saying. If anything, go back to cash and cut the credit cards.</p>

<h3 id="5-fear-of-breaking-it">5. Fear of Breaking it</h3>

<p>I have a woodshop that I enjoy spending time in. I also do a lot of handyman projects around the house. I can’t help but think that the times when I’m being active (and want to track it) that I’ll be prone to breaking a $350 watch!</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>It’s not for me. As much as I would like to convince myself that it would be a good idea (and I have tried), I can’t. It doesn’t allow me to do anything I can’t already do. The convenience is great, but it would be too convenient for my lifestyle. It’s a really nice piece of technology, but I’ll pass.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/File-Naming-and-(Dis)Organization.jpg" /><p>Naming and organizing files is extremely important. In today’s world, we can keep track of thousands of files. And with versioning getting to be a big deal, we have to have a way to keep track of it all.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>It’s quite common for me to get a file with revisions that has my original filename with something appended to the end. The typical is “v2” or the person’s initials “JB.” But every once in a while I get one back that has a monster attached to the end like, “v2 JB updated KR revised v4.” What?! Really?! Why is this ok?</p>

<p>I’ve also seen many folks that have hundreds, if not thousands, of folders. There will be project folders and people folders and general folders and pet folders and computer folders and and and…</p>

<p>Sometimes they have no overlap. But most of the time, a file can go multiple places. My question is: how do you decide which folder? And how long do you spend trying to decide?</p>

<p>A couple years ago, I was in the same place. I was randomly naming files and had folders full of folders full of folders. It took me 5 minutes to find a file and even then I was sometimes using search to find the one I was after.</p>

<p>Eventually, I got tired of it. I hated the never-ending folder structure and I desperately needed a common naming system. I did lots of research and tried to figure out what some other folks have done. They had a lot of really good ideas. But I eventually came up with my own system.</p>

<p>I wanted something that would easily follow me to any OS. I also wanted to use search for finding my files. I was already searching to find them anyway.</p>

<h2 id="my-nomenclature">My Nomenclature</h2>

<p>I spent a long time brainstorming this piece. It needed to be simple and scalable. But I also wanted it to work in conjunction with my folder system. Here’s an example of what I came up with:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">Refx_14BL22_File Naming Examples_20140820_063420.pages</code></pre></figure>

<p>That looks like a mess! Let me decode:</p>

<h3 id="tagging">Tagging</h3>

<p>The first part of that name is a tag. In this case, it’s for Reference files. I shortened it to Ref and added the <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/simple-trick-naming-tags/">“x” for easy searching</a>. When searching, this helps me filter down to just the type of file that I’m looking for. I have a number of them. Artx, Datax, Reportx, Reviewx, Templatex, etc…</p>

<h3 id="project-code">Project Code</h3>

<p>I create a personal code indicator for every project that I’m working on. If I have a file that pertains to a project, I add the code for the project to the name of the file. If it’s a standalone file, I simply leave it out.</p>

<p>Adding the project code to the filename allows me to search my entire computer for the project code and pull up everything about that project.</p>

<h3 id="key-words">Key Words</h3>

<p>This is what you commonly see in file names. Some words to help you understand what’s in the file itself.</p>

<h3 id="date-and-time">Date and Time</h3>

<p>I always add a date and sometimes add the time to the file name. The format of it is: YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS. This makes it easy for me to do a “Save As”, change the date, and keep my own versions of files. It’s an easy way to eliminate the “v2” thing that people put at the end of their filenames.</p>

<p>In the end, I get a filename that looks like this:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">tagx_PROJCODE_Key Words_DATE_TIME.ext</code></pre></figure>

<p>I wanted to make it easy for myself to name my files. So I created a TextExpander snippet for naming files with and without project codes. I also have a snippet that creates the date/time stamp for me. Between the two, it’s really easy for me to name files.</p>

<h2 id="my-folder-structure-or-lack-thereof">My Folder Structure (or lack thereof)</h2>

<p>I maintain 3 folders. That’s it. !nbox, Active, and Archive. This plays very nicely with my file naming system. Given their names, you can probably guess how it works. But just in case, here’s how I use them:</p>

<h3 id="nbox">!nbox</h3>

<p>Yes, that’s an exclamation point. I name it that way so that it’s sorted to the top of the folder list.</p>

<p>This is where all of my web downloads go and where I initially put any new file that I receive. This folder is in DropBox as I want these to sync across my computers and devices.</p>

<p>It truly is my inbox for files. At the end of each day, I process whatever is in this folder. Processing files means that I’m naming them (using the nomenclature above) and moving them to the Active folder.</p>

<h3 id="active">Active</h3>

<p>The Active folder is where I keep all of the files that I’m currently working on. Again, this folder is in DropBox so I can sync these across computers. Because I keep all of the files I’m currently working with in one folder, I know exactly where to go to find them. Simple.</p>

<h3 id="archive">Archive</h3>

<p>If I haven’t used a file in 60 days, I move it to my Archive folder. This lives on an external drive since it can be massive. The file naming I do really starts to shine here. Because they are all in one place, I rely on searching to find the file I want. I don’t have to look in here very often but when I do, I can usually find the files I want in about 4 seconds.</p>

<p>One note here: I am not about to go through my Active folder to find the files I haven’t touched in the last 60 days. And I certainly won’t do it every day. This is where I use <a href="http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php">Hazel</a>. I have a Hazel rule set up that checks my Active folder for any file that hasn’t been opened or modified in the last 60 days. If it finds any that match that criteria, it automatically moves them to my Archive folder. I never see it happen.</p>

<p>I’ve been using this system for a while now and really enjoy it. I’m always a few seconds away from any file I want. Until I realize I deleted instead of archiving. #facepalm</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/A-simple-trick-for-naming-tags.jpg" /><p>The search capabilities of many tools today is impressive. We can search titles, notes, filenames, and even the contents of a file. But if you’re searching for a tag, it can give you a lot more than you expected.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Take <a href="https://www.evernote.com/referral/Registration.action?uid=49404&amp;sig=e2dd914576c3ec9818e0311976a19dc1">Evernote</a> for example. In a single search, you get results that match tags, titles, body of the note, files, content inside files, words inside of pictures, and even locations for notes. I’m not a search expert, but I know that it’s easy for me to start typing in the search field and get a lot of results very quickly.</p>

<p>The trouble comes when I start using tags. Tags have a lot of power, but what happens when I have a tag name that matches a common word? Here’s a common scenario.</p>

<h2 id="my-coffee-dilemma">My Coffee Dilemma</h2>

<p>I keep a database of different coffees that I’ve tried in Evernote. I snap a picture and record some quick notes on it. I then tag the note with “coffee.” If I look at the tag for “coffee”, I see that I have about 28 notes on coffees that I’ve tried and rated.</p>

<p>However, I also keep a log of articles that I’ve read from the web. I do my reading in <a href="https://getpocket.com/">Pocket</a> and have it set up with <a href="http://ifttt.com">IFTTT</a> to send any Archived articles to Evernote. This is great when I remember reading something, but can’t remember where. I can search Evernote and find it pretty easy.</p>

<p>Because I like coffee, I seem to read a lot of articles that involve coffee in some way. So searching Evernote for “coffee” right now, I get 313 results. How am I supposed to find those 28? Scrolling?</p>

<p>In Evernote you can do the search like this: “tag:coffee”. That will eliminate the results that don’t have the tag and only give you what you want. But that doesn’t work on all systems. Not every app allows you to single out tags versus a search term. Even in Evernote, I don’t always remember to put the qualifier at the beginning of the search when I start. So I have to come back and add it.</p>

<h2 id="the-trick">The Trick</h2>

<p>I was listening to a <a href="http://www.macpowerusers.com/">Mac Power Users</a> podcast a while ago and learned of the “x” trick by <a href="http://www.merlinmann.com/">Merlin Mann</a>. It’s really simple. Add “x” to the end of your tag names. So instead of tagging my coffee database with “coffee”, I tag it with “coffeex”.</p>

<p>By adding “x” to the end of your tag names, you’re creating a word that you normally wouldn’t see. It’s a “made up” word. Since “x” isn’t used in a lot of words, it makes sense. You could also use “z” or “q,” as long it creates a word that you wouldn’t see in normal writing.</p>

<h2 id="result">Result</h2>

<p>So what does that do? It means that I can now search for “coffee” in Evernote and get all 313 results if I want. But it also means that I can add a single keystroke, “x”, and get just the 28 that I’ve tagged. And it works across systems. It’s not just an Evernote thing. It works in filenames, titles, and anything else that you want to search. Just add the “x” and you’ve created a tag that you can easily find in a search.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/Developing-a-Personal-Communication-Cycle.jpg" /><p>Recently a coworker confronted me on something I struggle with. Communicating. I’m introverted and love to come up with ideas, but I’m terrible at deciding when to share those ideas.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>It’s not that I don’t want my ideas to spread. It’s not that I don’t want to let people see what I’m thinking. I was simply waiting to share until someone asked or it was vital to the next steps of a project. But that put me in defense mode. I was constantly reacting to questions and demands.</p>

<p>The other issue I created was a lack of a clearly laid out plan. Since I wasn’t sharing my thoughts and actions on a project, the people involved were making their own plan. That created a lot of tension.</p>

<p>I’m currently transitioning from a <em>doer</em> role into a <em>leader</em> role in my career. And that means most of the work I do is developing ideas or making decisions. I didn’t fully realize this until my colleague gracefully approached me about it. And I’m grateful. It doesn’t help if I come up with an idea or make a decision and don’t tell anyone about it. Simple, I know, but that’s where I was.</p>

<p>I did some research on when to share ideas, but didn’t find a whole lot. So I spent some time thinking through my processes and decided to insert a <em>communicate</em> step into my workflow. With my mind having a systems-approach to things, it makes perfect sense to me.</p>

<p>Here’s the new 4-step process:</p>

<h2 id="1-collect">1. Collect</h2>

<p>The process starts by actively thinking through an idea or holding a meeting. I have information come to me or I generate it through mind maps, drawing on a whiteboard, or something to get the ideas out of my head.</p>

<h2 id="2-process">2. Process</h2>

<p>Once I have the information collected, I process it. If it’s from a meeting, I’ll look through my meeting notes and formulate my opinions and thoughts about what was discussed. If it’s an active thinking session, I’ll look over what I made in the process and do the same.</p>

<h2 id="3-communicate">3. Communicate</h2>

<p>Here’s the added step: once I’ve processed the information and have my opinions and thoughts put together, I write an email or set up a call to go over it. I make sure to include the actions that I’m planning when I do this.</p>

<h2 id="4-act">4. Act</h2>

<p>After I’ve communicated my thoughts and action plan, I start working on it. I work to complete the actions I laid out. Since I already shared the plan, I also have accountability to get it done in the time frame I laid out.</p>

<p>When I have the actions completed or have another idea, the process starts all over.</p>

<p>It’s a simple cycle. But in only a couple weeks, it has lowered my stress levels, helped me accomplish more, and helped our team see the vision behind the projects I’m leading. And that helps us all work better.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/If-it-ain't-broke-don't-fix-it-why-not.jpg" /><p><em>We’ve always done it that way. But it works. Why change it? If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.</em> When I hear these phrases I cringe. Yes, it works. Yes, it’s a smooth system. Yes, we’re familiar with it. <strong>But that doesn’t mean it shouldn’t change.</strong></p>

<!--more-->

<p>Confession: I’m one of those weird people that really likes change and thrives on it. But not everything needs to change all the time. I know that there are times when the status quo is a good thing. Too much change too fast can have very bad results. And change for the sake of change doesn’t make sense either. That’s when these questions can help.</p>

<p>Here are 4 questions to ask when you hear those cringe-inducing phrases:</p>

<h2 id="1-has-the-technology-changed">1. Has the technology changed?</h2>

<p>The tools at our disposal change every day. New apps or devices are always being created. And chances are that one of them will help you become more effective or efficient in some way.</p>

<p>Adopting new technology can sometimes prevent negative thoughts by customers. If you walked into a doctor’s office and heard the secretary using a typewriter, what would you think? Would you wonder if they were up on the latest ways of treating patients? If they haven’t adopted a computer for paperwork yet, can you trust that they will know what’s happened in medicine in the last 20 years?</p>

<h2 id="2-are-the-people-different">2. Are the people different?</h2>

<p>Sometimes a system or service is built around the people involved and the skill-sets they bring to the table. If the people change, the current systems might not make sense anymore. Or maybe you have new eyes on the process. They’ll have a new perspective that helps them see it differently.</p>

<h2 id="3-is-it-relevant">3. Is it relevant?</h2>

<p>Does the process or tool still accomplish its goal? Should you be doing it at all? Sometimes we work to put a system in place and it treats us well. But over time it becomes unnecessary. It doesn’t provide value anymore.</p>

<p>Data duplication is the most common form I’ve seen of this one. If you’re entering information into one system and then copying it into another, chances are that one of the two needs to disappear.</p>

<h2 id="4-has-the-purpose-changed">4. Has the purpose changed?</h2>

<p>Has your business changed? Do you find yourself trying to make an old tool work with your new goal? Maybe you’re trying to make something work when you should really step back and look at the overall process. It’s good to stick with tools that you know. But when you’re spending a lot of time working to make a tool work, you might need to re-evaluate the tool. I had to do this when I <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/getting-started-task-management/">switched from Evernote to Omnifocus</a> for task management. It took a couple weeks to switch, but it has been well worth the time.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/Choosing-the-3-MIT-for-the-Day.jpg" /><p>I’m terrible at estimating time. I always think that I can complete more than I truly can. I throw 8 things on a list for the day and go. I can complete them all… or not. If I’m honest with myself, I know that I can’t do it all.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I used to wake up in the morning and do my normal morning ritual. Part of that routine was to go through my to-do lists and choose tasks for that day. It was a good feeling to know I had prepared a list of actions for the day - my Today List.</p>

<h2 id="my-struggle">My Struggle</h2>

<p>At the end of the day, when I would start to wrap things up, I would realize I still had items on my list. Not a big deal. I’d just move them to tomorrow’s list.</p>

<p>But it would happen again. And again. And again. Once in a while I would finish it but most of the time the cycle repeated. It didn’t matter if I had a productive day or not. As long as I had items on that list at the end, it felt like I had lost. I didn’t do enough. I failed.</p>

<p>I tried to find productivity tricks to help me accomplish more during the day, but it never worked. The cycle continued.</p>

<h2 id="3-mits">3 MITs</h2>

<p>Thankfully, I ran across an article by Leo Babauta of <a href="http://www.zenhabits.net">Zen Habits</a>. It was about <a href="http://zenhabits.net/purpose-your-day-most-important-task/">picking your 3 MITs</a> or Most Important Tasks for the day. It’s a simple concept. Choose 3 things that you want to complete that day and focus on those. If you do nothing else all day, you still completed the most important things you needed to do.</p>

<p>I was a bit hesitant at first. I had more than 3 things I needed to do each day. But when I started to look at my list, I realized I had a lot of <em>wants</em> along with <em>needs</em> on it. I decided to try it and saw results on day one. I quickly finished my 3 MITs and realized that I had a productive day behind me and it was only 10am. It was energizing.</p>

<h2 id="the-head-game">The Head Game</h2>

<p>I learned that it was a head game. It’s the difference between achieving your goal and failing to hit it. If you set a realistic goal and hit it, you’re motivated to keep moving. If you set an optimistic goal and miss it, you’re disheartened and want to quit.</p>

<p>I’m not perfect with the process. I still find that I want to pick 4 or 5 items for the day, but if I stop long enough to think about each one I can usually find one or two that are <em>nice-to-haves</em> and pull them.</p>

<h2 id="bonus">Bonus</h2>

<p>There seems to be this awesome side-effect of accomplishing more each day. When I know that I’ve already had a productive day by 10am, it makes me want to keep going and knock a lot of things out.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/Getting-Started-with-Task-Management.jpg" /><p>I started keeping lists a few years ago. I had a lot going on and forgetting things was becoming normal. I needed a way to manage tasks since my brain was terrible at it.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I started by creating a list in Outlook of everything I needed to do, and that worked great for a while. But I found that I still had things slipping through the cracks. I needed a better way to see what was on my plate and a single list was overwhelming to look at.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them. - David Allen</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s when I came across David Allen’s <a href="http://gettingthingsdone.com/">Getting Things Done</a>. It completely changed my thought process. I decided to keep my system digital and wanted to use tools that I was familiar with. <strong>Don’t use apps you don’t know when adopting a methodology you don’t know.</strong> Learning two things at once will set you up for failure.</p>

<p>I had been using Evernote heavily and knew it well, so it was natural to use it for my list-making. It worked fine for learning GTD. I realized it wasn’t going to work out when I tried adopting <a href="http://www.thesecretweapon.org/">The Secret Weapon</a>. It was too much work for me.</p>

<p>I began a search for something more robust and went through the demo trials for all the popular task managers. I tried Remember The Milk, Things, Asana, Workflowy, Wunderlist, and even Reminders from Apple. I eventually landed on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/omnifocus-2/id867299399?mt=12&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1l3vnyQ">OmniFocus</a>.</p>

<p>It’s easy to get lost on a rabbit trail of new apps. Find apps that meld with your workflow and stick with them. It’s the process that matters, not the tool.</p>

<p>Here are the main facets of task management you’re looking to put in place:</p>

<h2 id="1-collect">1. Collect</h2>

<p>You need a way to grab ideas or tasks when they come to you. And you need it with you all the time. ALL THE TIME. I can’t emphasize that enough. You never know when you’ll remember something or have an idea. I use <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts-quickly-capture-notes/id502385074?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1l3vnyQ">Drafts</a> on the iPhone or my <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/what-is-an-hpda-and-how-do-i-use-it/">hPDA</a>. I always have one or both of these on me.</p>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-medium" src="/assets/posts_extra/Getting-Started-with-Task-Management-hPDA-Drafts.jpg" /></p>

<h2 id="2-keep-lists">2. Keep Lists</h2>

<p>Once you have things collected you need to organize them into lists. OmniFocus makes it easy to keep a list of tasks for each project. I can also assign a <em>context</em> for each task. That allows me to view that task from the project list and a context view. The context view makes it easy to group my tasks by the tools in front of me or circumstances I’m in. For example, I can view the tasks from all my projects that I can do when I’m Offline. Here’s a <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/omnifocus-setup-workflow/">more detailed view</a> of how I do it.</p>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-medium" src="/assets/posts_extra/Getting-Started-with-Task-Management-ProjectContextA.jpg" /></p>

<h2 id="3-review-your-lists">3. Review your lists</h2>

<p>The whole thing falls apart if you don’t look at it regularly. I do both a weekly and a <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/omnifocus-setup-workflow/">daily review</a>. My goal is to make sure I have everything up to date and determine actions for any stalled projects.</p>

<p>It’s also good to review your lists themselves on a regular basis. Do you have the right lists? Every few months I find that my circumstances have changed enough that I need to segment my actions in a slightly different way.</p>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-medium" src="/assets/posts_extra/Getting-Started-with-Task-Management-Review.jpg" /></p>

<h2 id="4-3-mits">4. 3 MITs</h2>

<p>MIT is short for Most Important Task. Every day, decide what 3 tasks are the most important for you to complete that day. This is key to creating a list for you to work on. If you select more than three for the day you’ll quickly feel overwhelmed at the start of your day and disappointed at the end of the day if and when you fail to complete them all (zero fun). Stick with 3 and try to check them off in the morning. If the rest of the day is lost, at least you’ll have completed the 3 most important items for the day.</p>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-medium" src="/assets/posts_extra/Getting-Started-with-Task-Management-Forecast.jpg" /></p>

<h2 id="5-waiting-list">5. Waiting List</h2>

<p>I’m also bad about tracking things others are working on that relate to me. Create a list where you track the actions or items that you’re waiting for. That can be a package to be delivered or a report to be turned in or even a meeting agenda item. These are items that you need to keep an eye on, but aren’t the one responsible for completing.</p>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-medium" src="/assets/posts_extra/Getting-Started-with-Task-Management-Waiting.jpg" /></p>

<p>It’s easy to be overwhelmed with the idea of tracking all of your tasks. Don’t be. It can be really simple. I just make my system really complex because I’m weird and like to spend hours trying to save a click or two. It can be as simple as a few notepads in a kitchen cupboard. Find a system that works for you and you’ll enjoy using.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/Gaining-Perspective-with-a-Daily-Review.jpg" /><p>How many times have you closed up shop for the day and wondered what happened? Ever get up in the morning and ask yourself what you should do today?</p>

<!--more-->

<p>With <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/put-distractions-place/">so many distractions around</a> and so many possibilities, it’s easy to lose track of what you should be doing. Especially if you’re <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/escaping-corporate-email-habit/">checking email constantly</a>, have people stopping by frequently, or you like to leave Facebook open.</p>

<p>I adopted the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKTg-ld2C80">Weekly Review</a> process from David Allen, but I found that it wasn’t frequent enough and things were slipping through the cracks. So I adapted it a bit and came up with this Daily Review. Doing this smaller review helps ease my mind at the end of each day.</p>

<p>The Daily Review is great for aligning your daily tasks with your goals or priorities. It’s a simple process that helps you reflect on what happened today (or the day before) and make a plan for the day ahead. Simply pick the time of day that’s best for you and go through the following steps. The end of the workday is best for me, so I have written the steps that way.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Tasks</p>

    <p>What did you complete today? Do you still have items on your list? Are these items what you want or need to be doing to meet your goals?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Calendar</p>

    <p>What’s on the schedule for tomorrow? Anything you need to prepare for?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inboxes</p>

    <p>Clear out any inboxes that you may have. This will help ensure that you’re completely up-to-date and not missing something.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reflection</p>

    <p>What are three things that went well today? What are three things you could improve on? Is what you’re working on today moving you toward your goals?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tomorrow</p>

    <p>Decide what you’re going to work on tomorrow. Choose 3 tasks that you’re going to tackle tomorrow.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Whether you choose to do it first thing in the morning, in the afternoon, or at night doesn’t matter. The goal is to put your day in perspective - to see your actions moving you towards your goals.</p>

<p>Making just a little progress can motivate you to press on.</p>

<p>You can find a copy of the Evernote checklist that I use for my Daily Review <a href="https://www.evernote.com/shard/s1/sh/2114c667-a2cd-4e7e-8861-1ffbe5ff74e2/086841bd608435352d56ae22be7dc339">here</a>.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/Adding-Contacts-from-Business-Cards-with-Evernote.jpg" /><p>I had just introduced myself to the executive leading the meeting. He handed me his business card and I quickly snapped a picture of it with my phone. A few seconds later his phone dinged. He glanced at his phone, then looked at me in shock.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>In mere seconds I had taken a picture of his business card, saved all of his information to my contacts, and emailed him my contact information. Since he had his phone set to notify him of emails (<a href="http://joebuhlig.com/escaping-corporate-email-habit/">a terrible idea</a>), his phone alerted him of the email. He quickly noticed it was from me and that I had sent him my contact information. Wow!</p>

<p>Here’s how it works:</p>

<h2 id="the-setup">The Setup</h2>

<p>Tools needed:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Smartphone</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.evernote.com/referral/Registration.action?uid=49404&amp;sig=e2dd914576c3ec9818e0311976a19dc1">Evernote</a> (requires Premium to scan more than 5 cards)</li>
  <li>Business card</li>
</ol>

<p>On iOS, you need to configure the following settings under <em>General</em> &gt; <em>Camera</em> &gt; <em>Business Cards</em>.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Turn on <em>Save to Contacts</em>.</li>
  <li>Turn on <em>Always Show</em> under <em>Follow-up options</em>.</li>
  <li>I also recommend connecting to LinkedIn.</li>
  <li>It works best to fill out <em>My contact info</em> as well.</li>
</ol>

<p><img class="center-image post-image-small" src="/assets/posts_extra/EvernoteBusinessCardSettings.jpeg" /></p>

<h2 id="the-process">The Process</h2>

<p>When you’re given a new business card, launch Evernote on your phone and open up the camera. Swipe to put it into Business Card mode and take a picture. Be sure to check off <em>Email my contact info</em> and you’re done.</p>

<p>From there, Evernote will create a new note in your Evernote account with the picture of the business card and all of the person’s contact information. It will also save that information into a new contact on your phone. Then it will send an email to the person (provided they have an email address on their card) with the contact information that you provided to Evernote. And it does all of this in just a few seconds. Brilliant!</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/Using-a-Text-Expander.jpg" /><p>Do you ever find yourself typing the same thing over and over again? Stuff like an email address, the date, a URL, or even a template of some kind? If so, a text expansion app might be just what you need.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I spend a lot of time on the computer. Working for a virtual company means most of my communication is through the phone or the computer, so I end up typing most of the day. That’s where text expansion comes in.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-text-expansion-app">What is a text expansion app?</h2>

<p>It’s an app that runs in the background. It allows you to type a string of characters that will expand into a longer string of characters. For example, I have a snippet that allows me to type ;td (short for <em>today’s date</em>) and it will remove ;td and replace it with 20140711. In other words, it will take ;td and expand it into today’s date. It’s kind of like a keyboard shortcut for text.</p>

<p>There are quite a few text expanders out there: Phrase Express, AutoHotKey, aText, Typinator, TypeIt4Me. Personally, I prefer <a href="http://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/index.html">TextExpander</a>. It comes with AppleScript support and allows me to sync my snippets across computers.</p>

<h2 id="examples">Examples:</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>;td</strong> = 20140711</p>

    <p>Gives me today’s date in the format of YYYYMMDD. I use this one a lot for titling a new Evernote note or naming files.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>;tt</strong> = 20140711_060327</p>

    <p>Gives me the time right now in the format of YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS. Really handy for adding a time stamp to filenames.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>;9tom</strong> = 20140712 9am</p>

    <p>Allows me to easily set a start date in <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/omnifocus-setup-workflow/">Omnifocus</a> for 9am tomorrow morning.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>;joe</strong> = <em>My email address</em></p>

    <p>Email addresses are used all over the place. I just got tired of typing it all the time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>;newp</strong> = https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?fs=1&amp;view=cm&amp;shva=1&amp;su&amp;tf=1</p>

    <p>This is awesome if you use Gmail as your email client. This URL will give me a blank email without taking me to my inbox. I can go to the address bar and type ;newp and it will expand into the link. I have a separate one (;neww) for my work email.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>;sigp</strong> = <em>My personal email signature</em></p>

    <p>I’ve never liked the automatic email signature addition that a lot of email clients have. This allows me to turn it off entirely and easily enter my signature when and where I want it. Again, I have a separate snippet for my work signature (;sigw).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>;cc</strong> = <em>My conference call dial-in information</em></p>

    <p>When I’m setting up a meeting, I can type 3 quick characters and get all of my information without having to look it up.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>You’ll notice that I use a semicolon at the beginning of each my snippets. I don’t want my shortcuts to be something that I may accidentally type when I don’t want them. I use the semicolon because it’s a character that I don’t normally use in everyday writing and it’s never immediately followed by anything other than a space.</p>

<p>I’m only breaking the surface with what you can do with a text expansion tool. Any names, urls, agenda templates, addresses or even common misspellings can be added to make life just a little bit easier and give you some time back. According to my stats in TextExpander, I’ve saved 8 hours of typing since January. Whoa!</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/My-Omnifocus-Setup-and-Workflow.jpg" /><p><a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/omnifocus-2/id867299399?mt=12&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1l3vnyQ">OmniFocus</a> is a powerful tool designed to follow David Allen’s <a href="http://gettingthingsdone.com/">Getting Things Done</a>. I go into the <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/getting-things-done-introduction/">details of GTD here</a> but the simple version is that it’s a method of getting things out of your mind and into a trusted organizational system. The main purpose is to free up your mind to have ideas, not hold them.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>This article focuses on Omnifocus 2 for Mac. I use the iPhone and iPad versions as well, but here I want to walk you through the setup of my central hub.</p>

<p>There are two main sides of Omnifocus: Projects and Contexts. Every action item is part of one project and is assigned one context.</p>

<h2 id="projects">Projects</h2>

<p><img class="right-image" src="/assets/posts_extra/My-Omnifocus-Setup-and-Worflow-Project-List.jpg" /></p>

<p>Using David Allen’s definition, projects are anything you need to do that takes two or more actions to complete. Building a new website is definitely a project, but changing a light bulb could also be a project. You may have to go to the store, buy the light bulb, and then change out the bulb. That’s three actions that are needed to change a light bulb, which means it’s a project.</p>

<p>In Omnifocus, there is the ability to create folders and hierarchies of projects. This is to help gain perspective on what is important and to make it easier to find things. The best way I’ve found to organize projects is by areas of life. For example, I’m a husband, father, son/brother, and friend. But I also have areas around my faith, personal actions, work, this blog, our church, the house and car, and my hobby of woodworking.</p>

<p>I created a folder for each of these and put them in order of priority. The order of the folders is important when I start looking at lists later on. I can sort by project and it will arrange the tasks based on the order of my folders.</p>

<p>Each folder contains a list of projects associated with that area of life as well as a Single Actions List for each area. These are miscellaneous lists for each area. They contain one-step actions and can be done in any order. They are never checked off as they are constantly being emptied and refilled.</p>

<div class="clear"></div>

<h2 id="contexts">Contexts</h2>

<p><img class="right-image" src="/assets/posts_extra/My-Omnifocus-Setup-and-Worflow-Context-List.jpg" /></p>

<p>Contexts are just that. They are the context you need to be in to complete a task. This could be the tools (iPad, paper, laptop), locations (grocery store, hardware store, mom’s house), mindsets (brainstorming, reading, writing), or even <a href="http://simplicitybliss.com/a-fresh-take-on-contexts">energy levels</a> (high energy, normal energy, low energy). Everyone has different contexts that work for them. Here’s what I’m currently using:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>@Omnifocus</strong> — Things I need to do in Omnifocus to keep it up to date. Sometimes I need to add a new project, but I don’t have time to think it through right now. So I add it here.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>@Communicate</strong> — Phone calls, emails, social media responses, text messages, etc… They all go here. I tried to break them out at one point, but I found that I was cycling through all of them at the same time anyway. So I’ve lumped them all together. My goal is to try and empty this list once a day as I’m always thinking of people I need to connect with in some way.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>@Computer</strong> — Most of my work is done on the computer so this list can sometimes be long.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>@Writing</strong> — I set aside time in the mornings to do my writing. Most items pertain to this blog, but there are times when I have other articles or snippets that I need to write out for work or elsewhere. It works out really well to pull these items together into a separate list that I can view when I have time for it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>@Offline</strong> — When 8:30pm comes around, I try to <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/leaving-phone/">go device-free</a>. I usually spend that time reading or talking with my wife. Regardless, I have this list of items I can do when I’m not on a computer. I also schedule some time to go work on this list every couple of days to make sure I’m not letting things slide.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>@After Hours</strong> — This is mostly a list of things that need done around the house or on the car. I pull up this list on weekends or after I shut down work for the day. Mowing the lawn, cleaning up the wood-shop, and attacking thistles are typical items you would find here.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>@Admin</strong> — Administrative tasks like expense reports (which I’m terrible at completing on time), scanning documents and ordering office supplies.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>@Distractions</strong> — My favorite! Anytime something comes to me that I would like to explore, (like a new app or website), I collect it here. The idea is to come back to this list when I have free-time. Since free-time eludes me frequently, I tend to look through this list when I have 5 minutes to spare in between meetings. A lot of the items on this list don’t really have an “end,” so it’s easy to lose an hour here if I’m not careful. Filling in gaps when I have a tight timeframe works really well.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>@Waiting</strong> — This is one of my most important contexts. I collect items here that I need to talk to others about. It also contains things that I’m physically waiting on like packages being delivered. Most folks like to separate the two and have an @Agendas list for each person that they come into contact with. That gets way too long for me. So I put them all in one list and start the action’s title with the person’s name. Then I can either sort by title or do a quick search when I’m talking with someone I need to follow up with.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>@Expectations</strong> — Here’s one that’s a bit different and I’m still working on. It’s not really a list of actions. It’s a list of what people expect from me. I want to make sure I meet or exceed expectations as much as possible so I track them. I haven’t found a great way to incorporate these yet, but I’m getting close to something that works.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>@Geofenced</strong> — Lifesaver! There are a number of physical locations underneath of this one. Menards, Trader Joe’s, cities, and even states. Each one is a list of things I need to either pick up or do when I get there. I need to know that I need to pick up screws when I’m near Menards or that we need syrup when I’m near Trader Joe’s. You can set up the location on your iPhone for each location. Then when you’re close to the location it sends you a notification with the list of items for that location. Genius! Forgetting toilet paper is not fun.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<div class="clear"></div>

<h2 id="perspectives">Perspectives</h2>

<p><img class="right-image" src="/assets/posts_extra/My-Omnifocs-Setup-and-Workflow-Perspectives.jpg" /></p>

<p>This is where the work gets done. Think of perspectives as a saved search and “view” of Omnifocus. You can focus on one project or folder of projects or even multiples of each and save that into a perspective. You can also choose to show the projects or the contexts for the list of actions you want. You can set the filter, sort, and grouping methods. All of those are saved into a perspective.</p>

<p>I use most of the default perspectives that come with Omnifocus, but I do have a few others that I use frequently. Here are the ones I’ve tweaked or created:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Forecast</strong> — This is a default perspective, but I’ve altered the settings to include “Deferred Items”. Those are actions that aren’t available until that day. Since I use start dates heavily, this helps me to see what has been added to my available lists for that day.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Work</strong> — A context view of what’s on my plate for my work. It shows me all the available items with a focus on my Work folder of projects so it filters out everything else.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Blog</strong> — Similar to my work context but has a focus on my Blog folder of projects.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Waiting</strong> — Shows me the list of items I have in the @Waiting context. I have this as a separate perspective, as opposed to using the context. I do this because of the ability to sort by title in the perspective. Because I use a naming convention for these, the sort by title makes it easier to quickly find what I’m after.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Added</strong> — I got this one and the next one from David Sparks at <a href="http://macsparky.com/blog/2014/6/my-omnifocus-perspectives">MacSparky</a>. It shows me all of my actions and sorts them by “Date Added” descending. Sometimes I add something and then realize I made a mistake on it. This makes it easy to find the most recently added items.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Changed</strong> — Another from David. Similar to Added but it shows me the items that were most recently changed. I sometimes make mistakes when editing items, too. This helps me find those.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<div class="clear"></div>

<h2 id="my-workflow">My Workflow</h2>

<p>Overall, the GTD process is to collect items, process, organize, review, and do. Omnifocus helps me with the whole thing in one way or another.</p>

<h3 id="collect">Collect</h3>

<p>I have three modes of collecting. One is when I’m in the office or on the computer. The second is when I’m away from the computer but I can use my hands, (not driving). The last is when I’m driving or can’t use my hands.</p>

<p>When I’m on the computer, I simply use the Omnifocus quick capture shortcut. I can invoke it with a simple keyboard shortcut — control + option + space. If I’m doing this I will usually enter the project and context for each item when I collect it. Then I have the process/organize pieces done already.</p>

<p>If I’m away from the computer and have free hands, I’ll either grab it with <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts-quickly-capture-notes/id502385074?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1l3vnyQ">Drafts</a> on the iPhone or in my <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/what-is-an-hpda-and-how-do-i-use-it/">handy hPDA</a>. Drafts will send it to my inbox in Omnifocus where I can either add the details immediately in my phone or I can choose to leave it in my Inbox for later. My hPDA notes will land in my physical inbox by my desk where I can enter those into the system later as well.</p>

<p>When I’m traveling or can’t use my hands to type or write, Siri comes to the rescue. Omnifocus for iPhone has this cool feature that allows me to grab items from the Reminders app and put them into my Omnifocus inbox. Since I can add items to a Reminders list with Siri, the process is seamless from Siri to Omnifocus.</p>

<h3 id="process">Process</h3>

<p>I process my inboxes and enter all the information for everything about once a day. I do it more often on days when I feel like I’m adding a lot to it. I don’t always feel comfortable leaving a large number of items in my inboxes.</p>

<h3 id="organize">Organize</h3>

<p>For the most part this is done automatically by Omnifocus. Since I’ve taken the time to set up my project structure and my contexts beforehand, I really just need to add to it. Omnifocus does the hard work of making things show up where they should automagically.</p>

<p>Sometimes when I find myself entering new projects or just working with the organization of my tasks, I’ll find myself jumping from perspective to perspective quite a bit. So I put a bunch of keyboard shortcuts in place to help me quickly move from place to place.</p>

<h3 id="review">Review</h3>

<p>Once a week (Friday mornings), I review my whole system. Yep. The <em>whole</em> thing. I look through every project I have and make sure I have everything up to date and check my workload for the week ahead. Again, Omnifocus has a way to help with this. It has a Review perspective that can take you through all of your projects. You make any changes you need to the project and then “Mark as Reviewed.” Done. Go on to the next one. This is a really slick feature that makes it simple.</p>

<h3 id="do">Do</h3>

<p>Omnifocus is really great at keeping all your tasks in place, but it does you no good if you don’t actually check things off.</p>

<p>At the beginning of the day, I start working from the Forecast perspective. It shows me any items that are due that day and shows me my calendar as well. I don’t use due dates unless something will break or be a big problem if not completed by that time. That means if it has a due date for today, I’m going to do it. By using the Forecast view, I know what the landscape of my day looks like. I know when meetings are to happen and where to fill it with the items that are due.</p>

<p>Once I’ve completed all the due items from the Forecast, I move on to the Flagged perspective. During my Daily Review, I flag items that are “nice to haves”. These are actions that I would like to complete that day, but nothing will die if I don’t. It’s what I expect to do.</p>

<p>If I complete all my due tasks and have made it through all of my flagged items, I move on to the Contexts perspective and start working on whatever context I find myself in. If I get to this point, I consider it a productive day. It tells me that I’ve completed everything that I <em>needed</em> to do and that I <em>wanted</em> to do.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, I do a <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/gaining-perspective-daily-review/">Daily Review</a>. I take 20 minutes or so and quickly look over calendars, completed items from the day, and set up tomorrow. Basically, I look at the Forecast view for tomorrow and see what’s on my plate. If I have a lot going on, I typically won’t flag any <em>extra</em> items. If I don’t have anything due and I have no meetings, I’ll run through my contexts and flag actions for tomorrow and set the start date for tomorrow morning. That way they don’t show up when I’m doing one last check before I go to bed. There’s no point in seeing them until tomorrow.</p>

<p>This is my system and I’ve found it to work really well for me. I hope you can find a piece or two of it that helps, even if you’re not an Omnifocus user.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/What-is-an-hPDA.jpg" /><p>Ideas and reminders come to us when we’re not ready for them or when we can’t do anything about them. We remember to clean out the gutters when it’s raining. An idea for a new website comes to us when we’re eating dinner. What do you do with those?</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="write-it-down">Write it down.</h2>

<p>We see this advice a lot. My problem was not being prepared to write it down when the thought occurred. I never had a pen and I could never find paper.</p>

<p>In the past, my phone was always <a href="http://joebuhlig.com/leaving-phone/">with me</a> so it was only logical to try using it first. I could type things into <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts-quickly-capture-notes/id502385074?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1l3vnyQ">Drafts</a>, but what if it was a sketch? I could pull up <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/adobe-ideas/id364617858?mt=8&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1l3vnyQ">Adobe Ideas</a> and sketch it out, but I’ve never liked the feel of sketching on a touchscreen. And it’s never as accurate as I’d like.</p>

<p>I knew I wanted to keep pen and paper with me, but it didn’t work out to keep a notebook with a pen around all the time. I learned about an hPDA when I was searching for a solution to this problem.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-an-hpda">What is an hPDA?</h2>

<p>hPDA stands for Hipster Parietal Disgorgement Aide or Hipster PDA. It was <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2004/09/03/introducing-the-hipster-pda">developed</a> by Merlin Mann. It’s basically a tongue-in-cheek spin-off of the digital <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_(PDA)">PDAs from Palm</a> and their lineup of handhelds. Remember those? Yes, we’ve come a long way.</p>

<p>To make your very own hPDA you will need:</p>

<ol>
  <li>10-15 Index cards</li>
  <li>Small binder clip</li>
  <li>Pen of your choosing</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Approximate cost = $5</strong></p>

<p>Instructions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Take a few index cards and clip them together with the binder clip.</li>
  <li>Insert hPDA and pen into pocket (or bag).</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="how-do-i-use-it">How do I use it?</h2>

<p>It’s small enough that you can keep it with you always. Whenever you remember something you need to do or an idea pounces on you, simply write it in your hPDA. It doesn’t matter if it’s a sketch or line items, you have what you need.</p>

<p>Then you need to do something with it, (unless you enjoy swimming in index cards). Personally, I enter these items in either <a href="https://www.evernote.com/referral/Registration.action?uid=49404&amp;sig=e2dd914576c3ec9818e0311976a19dc1">Evernote</a> or <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus">Omnifocus</a>(<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/omnifocus-2/id867299399?mt=12&amp;uo=4&amp;at=1l3vnyQ">download</a>) depending on what the item is. It doesn’t matter where you keep the information as long as you know where to find it and can get to it easily. Once I’m done with the card, I tear it up and throw it away.</p>

<p>Once I found an index card in the trash that I hadn’t processed, (no, I’m not a trash digger). Since then, I started ripping up the cards or marking them so I know I’m done with them. Then they hit the trash.</p>

<h2 id="bonus">Bonus</h2>

<p>An added bonus to this is having a way to give information to others. I’ve often found that I’ll be talking with someone and need to write down the name of an app for them. Or they need to write down a phone number. It’s no longer an issue. I just pull out the hPDA and pen. Done.</p>

<p>I still use Drafts to collect simple text notes. But there are times when I don’t have my phone around or I just want to write it on paper. That’s when the hPDA shines.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/Leaving-Your-Phone.jpg" /><p>Have you ever intentionally left your phone in the car while on a date? Was it freeing or did it feel like prison? Have you ever, like me, found yourself on Twitter while at the dinner table? Was that any different?</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Are we too attached or even addicted to our phones? I have a hard time answering that question. I want the answer to be no, but I hesitate because I think the answer could be yes.</p>

<p>This past Sunday was Father’s Day. I wanted to be Super Dad and stay focused on my wife and daughter. To be successful I knew I needed to put the phone out of reach and avoid picking it up as much as possible.</p>

<p>This is always a big challenge for me. I’m one of those people who has his phone with him at all times. I keep it on me. Always. It feels weird not having it either in my pocket or on the desk in front of me.</p>

<p>After Cutie woke up from her nap, we decided to go for a walk. We love walks! We usually put at least a mile or two behind us. This time I decided to leave my phone behind. I usually bring it “in case something happens”. That’s my crap rationalization at it’s best. Especially since Becky has her phone in the stroller anyway. This time, I decided to leave it at home.</p>

<p>And it was a great walk! We enjoyed the outdoors and had a great conversation. I didn’t need my phone. It was just fine at home without my attention.</p>

<p>This little victory over my phone taught me that I need to separate more often. I get to experience things a bit differently when I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z7dLU6fk9QY">look up</a> from it. Here are 4 steps I’m taking to help create more balance:</p>

<h2 id="1-internet-free-sundays">1. Internet-free Sundays</h2>

<p>One day a week, I’m going to make an attempt to shut down the data on my phone and turn off the wifi on all my devices.</p>

<p>I’m choosing Sundays as I normally take a day of rest then. I want my sole focus to be on my family. Not that it isn’t at other times, but I want to be more intentional about it on this day.</p>

<p>To be honest, this one scares me. The “what if” monster is screaming in my head. If it was easy and simple, I would have done it already. But that doesn’t mean it won’t pay off in the end.</p>

<h2 id="2-leave-my-phone-in-the-office-over-lunch">2. Leave my phone in the office over lunch</h2>

<p>Since I work from home, I enjoy lunch with my family most days. I usually take my phone with me when I head upstairs. No more. I’m leaving it in the office unless I’m expecting a call from a client. If I need to collect an idea or a to-do, I’ll write it in my <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hipster_PDA">hPDA</a>. That’s much less intrusive than opening an app to write something down. It’s less distracting too.</p>

<h2 id="3-do-not-disturb-during-play-time">3. “Do Not Disturb” during play time</h2>

<p>I really enjoy play time with Cutie. We have a blast! To keep my phone from being a distraction and help me focus on her, I’m going to start enabling DND mode beforehand. I don’t want <em>anything</em> to distract me during that time… unless it’s my wife asking me to kill a bug for her. Bugs make life stand still.</p>

<p>I’m choosing DND mode over Airplane mode because I may still need to take phone calls from important people (mostly family) during those times. The “what if” monster keeps showing up and reminding me of potential emergencies.</p>

<h2 id="4-device-free-after-830">4. Device-free after 8:30</h2>

<p>This one will be hard for me. I like to browse through feeds and read articles at night. But that usually means I’m not reading my book or having a conversation with my wife. Both of which have greater value to me than RSS feeds.</p>

<p>We try to get to bed around 9pm or shortly after, so I’m giving myself 30 minutes of screen-free time before bed. There’s a lot of <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/07/us-sleep-technology-idUSTRE7260RH20110307">research</a> that shows the benefits of disconnecting before bed.</p>

<p>That’s my game plan. I’ll try it out for a while and see what parts help.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/Escaping-the-Corporate-Email-Habit.jpg" /><p>I used to pride myself in having one of the fastest email replies in the office. If you sent me an email, I was back to you in less than 10 minutes. Sometimes 5.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>Like most corporations, we used Outlook for email and calendaring. I had it set up to alert me every time I got a new email. On average, I was receiving around 100 emails a day. That’s a lot of dings. In the office environment, email was as good as IM.</p>

<p>It’s interesting what 100 dings in a day will do to your focus. Every time I got into the groove of something I heard that ding and my Pavlovian instinct kicked in. I read and responded to the email and went back to work. That’s fine, but I then spent a few minutes trying to get back into the groove I had just lost. It wasn’t working. The more email I sent, the more I received and my projects were suffering because of it.</p>

<h2 id="turning-off-email">Turning off email?</h2>

<p>I had read and listened to a lot of folks that <a href="http://macsparky.com/blog/2008/8/21/mail-notification-liberation.html">turned off email notifications</a> and checked email <a href="http://michaelhyatt.com/breaking-e-mail-addiction.html">only a few times</a> during the day. It seemed ridiculous to me. <em>Why would I make people wait to hear back from me? What if something urgent comes up? What if my boss needs something?</em> It didn’t make sense to me.</p>

<p>But these people seemed to like it. And if it worked for them all the time I figured I could try it for a day. If it worked, great! If not, oh well. I’d look for a different solution.</p>

<h2 id="the-plan">The plan</h2>

<p>I scheduled 9 times to process my email that day. I didn’t want to go crazy and only open Outlook once all day. That was too much. So I chose to check it once an hour during the work day. I would spend as long as I needed at the top of every hour to bring my inbox down to empty — I was already maintaining inbox zero.</p>

<h2 id="the-first-day">The first day</h2>

<p>The first email check was fine. It was at the beginning of the day and I had to get caught up from the late night emails (crazy night owls). But then I had to shut Outlook down. That was hard. I don’t think I had done that for anything other than restarting my computer since I started with the company almost 2 years before. But I managed to do it.</p>

<p>I was sitting on a porcupine that hour. I kept wondering if I had something in my email that I needed to respond to. I was pretty much useless. Zero work accomplished, sir. I was watching the clock - just waiting for the chance to open Outlook. At the top of the hour, I promptly started rifling through emails.</p>

<p>What struck me was the lack of urgency in them. There wasn’t anything that needed a response right away. <em>That’s odd</em>. So I closed it down again and went back to work. I was still thinking about it, but it wasn’t as pressing this time.</p>

<p>The next email check came and although there was a couple of things that were urgent, they didn’t <em>need</em> an immediate response. They could wait a few hours, but only waited about 30 minutes. This process continued throughout the day.</p>

<p>At the end, I realized that I had accomplished a lot of my actual work and had managed to keep up with email. No buildings burned down. My boss didn’t throw a fit. And I felt pretty good about the day. It had been one of my most productive days in a long time.</p>

<h2 id="since-leaving-corporate">Since leaving corporate</h2>

<p>I’ve since left the corporate office scene and work from home full time. I now check my email twice a day. If something is important enough that someone needs a response quicker than 5 hours, they call me. If they’re going to call me, why would I spend my time monitoring my inbox? I’ve got better things to do.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/Desktop-Tower-Move.jpg" /><p>I didn’t want to write this post. I don’t want you to read it. My wife wanted me to write it. I hesitated. Writing it forces me to admit that I’m picky and maybe neurotic. So it’s probably a good thing that I did write it.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I work from home full-time, so it’s imperative that I have a workspace that is my own. I work from our family room. There’s a fireplace, a bathroom, and an awesome sectional that’s great for naps. It also has a closet.</p>

<h2 id="the-closet">The closet</h2>

<p>It’s a couple feet deep with bi-fold doors on it. I put a desk and some shelves inside the closet and turned it into an office. I can close the doors and make it all disappear. It’s pretty slick.</p>

<h2 id="the-original-setup">The original setup</h2>

<p>My powerhouse, the Mac Pro, was sitting off to the right hand side of the monitors. As you can imagine, cords are a nightmare. I found a way to feed the cords down below the desk and keep them organized. It was a lot of work to do it that way, but it’s clean.</p>

<h2 id="my-completely-understandable-problem">My completely understandable problem</h2>

<p>I began to have rogue gadgets. I have an external disc drive (that I almost never use) and a 7 port USB hub. I also began to plug more and more things into the tower itself. Off to the right hand side of my keyboard and mouse, I also had a notepad and my phones and my pens and notecards and… you get the idea. On the left side all I had was a set of headphones and a cup of coffee. Issue: <em>I’m right-handed</em>.</p>

<h2 id="my-brilliant-solution">My brilliant solution</h2>

<p>I’m no brain surgeon but I could see that I had to do something here. I was piling everything on the right side–the area I always wanted to use for taking notes or pretty much anything else. I moved the tower over to the left, which sounds a lot easier than it was. I use three computer monitors and they come with lots of cords. I had to move network cables, phone chargers, a scanner, a webcam, my headphone extension, two cables per monitor, wireless router cables, printer cords, power strips, two external hard drives, and even my trash can. I had to move pretty much everything. Oh, except my pen cup. It stayed.</p>

<h2 id="the-results">The results</h2>

<p>After an hour of work I gained approximately 0 inches of space on the right side. <em>What?</em> Maybe I did something wrong, but when I started using it I realized I had the same amount of space that I did before. But it looks nice! And it feels better. At least, that’s what I tell myself.</p>

        <![CDATA[<img class="featured-image" src="http://localhost:4000/assets/posts/Put-Distractions-In-Their-Place.jpg" /><p>We have everything at our fingertips. We can look something up instantly and connect with almost anyone at any time.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I was having a blast with my daughter on the floor. I chased her around the kitchen island and back into the living room. She loved it! Especially if we did it again and again and again. Around in circles we went!</p>

<p>Then my pocket said, “Ding!”. I pulled out my phone to see what it was. Someone I didn’t know had favorited one of my tweets on Twitter. Wait! <em>What just happened?</em> I stopped playing with my daughter to acknowledge that a stranger liked something I posted on social media. A stranger took priority over my daughter. In what world is that okay?</p>

<p>How do we deal with distractions appropriately? We have a lot of them, and what qualifies as a distraction seems to be different for everyone. For me it can be social media, the urge to check email, unimportant phone calls, and every “ding” my pocket makes—and I’m terrible at dealing with them if I’m not prepared.</p>

<p>I’ve adopted these three habits to put distractions in their place:</p>

<h2 id="turn-off-notifications">Turn off notifications</h2>

<p>There are few things your screens <em>need</em> your attention for. Think about that. How important is it that you know immediately when you’re mentioned on Twitter? How important is it that you know the moment a new email comes in? Do you really need to know that someone beat you at Angry Birds the instant it happens?</p>

<p>Go through your phone and turn off every notification you can bring yourself to turn off. This is hard. Really hard. If you’re used to getting these types of alerts you will feel like something is missing. That’s okay, you’ll get used to it.</p>

<h2 id="collect-it">Collect it</h2>

<p>When you remember something you need to do, write it down. When an idea comes to you, write it down. When you notice something that needs fixed or taken care of, write it down. You don’t need to act immediately (unless it’s an emergency, of course). Just collect it somewhere that you will be reminded of it later. I use a combination of <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/">Omnifocus</a> and <a href="https://www.evernote.com/referral/Registration.action?uid=49404&amp;sig=e2dd914576c3ec9818e0311976a19dc1">Evernote</a> to do this.</p>

<p>Omnifocus keeps track of the things I need to do. Evernote keeps track of pretty much everything else. For both, I use my handy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hipster_PDA">hPDA</a> or I’ll use <a href="http://agiletortoise.com/drafts/">Drafts</a> on the iPhone to collect the thought and send it where it belongs. <strong>Put the distraction aside for now and come back to it later when you have time.</strong></p>

<h2 id="schedule-time-for-distractions">Schedule time for distractions</h2>

<p>This has worked wonders for me. I’m someone that can easily jump onto <a href="http://www.quora.com/">Quora</a> or <a href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a> and spend way too much time there. I have to set a specific time aside for them and make sure there’s a limit. I like to lump all my social media checking together. I run through it a couple times a day and try to spend no more than 10 minutes on it—unless there’s a post on productivity :) I even schedule time for email. <strong>It’s not a distraction if I have time allocated for it.</strong></p>

<p>I have time in the late morning and the afternoon to process my inbox. Yes, there are times when I fail. Coming from a corporate environment, I find myself wanting to leave it open all day, but that doesn’t help my productivity one bit. Have you ever been to a family gathering and noticed all your relatives on their devices? Ever gone to a restaurant with friends and found yourself checking email? It’s a recent struggle that our culture finds itself up against. What are you doing to fight it?</p>
