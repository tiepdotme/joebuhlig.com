<p>Want to get in touch? Awesome! But first:</p>

<p>1. Is your question about one of the articles I've written? Consider posting your request on the <a href="https://discourse.joebuhlig.com">Discussion site</a> so others can benefit.</p>
<p>2. If you have a technical question and you haven't tried Google, spend 10 minutes there before moving on.</p>
<p>3. I do my best to process email once a day but I don't always get to it. And when I do, <strong>I don't take the time to respond to every message due to a commitment to meaningful and quality work</strong>.</p>
<p>4. If you have an interesting proposal, an issue with one of the sites or products I maintain, or feel you have something I should know, please send me a <a href="https://discourse.joebuhlig.com/users/joebuhlig">private message on the Discourse.</p>
